An organization refers to a store, business firm, hospital, or restaurant. See\nv2 customer APIs\nand\nv1.1 customer APIs\n.\nTransactions\n: A transaction represents a purchase or return event. The parameters for transaction APIs are configuration dependent. See more details\nv2 transaction APIs\nand\nv1.1 transaction APIs\n.\nStore\n: The store entity holds information about an organization's stores and hierarchy. This entity provides APIs to manage stores. To know more, see\nStore APIs\n.\nProduct\n: The product entity holds all products of an org and product-related information such as size, color, type, and brand. Product APIs allow you to fetch details of a specific product, modify existing details, change a product's brand name, and create new attributes for a product. See\nProduct APIs\n.\nBehavioral Events\n: Behavioral events help capture customer activities such as registration, forgot passwords, and cart abandonment. You can create custom events, fetch event data, configure event fields, and do more with\nEvents APIs\n.\nCard\n: Cards are loyalty identifiers and enable orgs t o run card-based memberships. Cards are associated with a card series and each customer can have multiple cards. A card number or an card external ID is a unique identifier of a customer and is used in fetching customer details. See more about\nCards APIs.\nUser Group\n: The new user group (v2) solves the use cases of both B2B loyalty and B2C loyalty unlike the previous version which was designed for B2C cases. This entity contains APIs to manage user groups. See more about\nUser Group.\nLeads\n: A lead is a purchase an individual is interested in, especially for offline stores. Leads can be created for both loyalty and non-loyalty customers. This entity provides you the APIs to create, manage and fetch leads. See more about\nLeads APIs.\n.\nExtended Fields\nExtended Fields are proposed fields to standardize input values and keys across organizations. These fields make it easier for the Development and Analytics teams to get rid of the complex data that flows into the database, through existing custom fields. Developers control the field names, data types, enum values, and scopes for the extended fields and can capture values based on rules (logical or regex expressions).\nAn extended field is a predefined field with an id, name, entity type, label name, and data type.  Example: GUID, IMEI, making changes, and so on. Extended fields are used in customer registration, profile update, transaction, and transaction line item.\n📘\nExtended fields are created in the backend. You can just use whatever is required for you. to show or hide it on the UI.\nThe following are the topics discussed in this article.\nEntity Types\nSupported Entity Types: customer, regular_transaction, return_transaction, not_interested_transaction, not_interested_return_transaction, regular_lineitem, return_lineitem, not_interested_lineitem, not_interested_return_lineitem.\nData Type\nSupported Data types:  integer, string, double, date-time, standard_enum, custom_enum\ni. Standard Enum: Consists of predefined values that are common for any org. In the DB table, an extended field with the type standard_enum is mapped to one or more values.\nii. Custom Enum: Consists of predefined values for each field and each value is mapped to a specific org. A value can be mapped to different orgs.\nThe following example shows the values of an extended field are mapped to different orgs (scope_ids).\nJSON\nid: 1\n\n      ef_id: 9\n\n   scope_id: 797\n\n      value: 他他他他\n\n created_by: -1\n\n created_on: 2017-03-23 15:18:16\n\nmodified_by: -1\n\nmodified_on: 2017-03-23 15:18:16\n\n*************************** 2. row ***************************\n\n         id: 2\n\n      ef_id: 9\n\n   scope_id: 1115\n\n      value: 他他他\n\n created_by: -1\n\n created_on: 2017-03-23 15:22:39\n\nmodified_by: -1\n\nmodified_on: 2017-03-23 15:22:39\nProperties of Extended Fields\nFollowing are the properties of extended fields.\nThe combination of name and entity type for extended fields should be unique\nExtended fields are not case-sensitive\nMapping of Extended Fields\nOn a broader view, extended fields are mapped to vertical ids, and vertical ids are mapped to org ids as shown in the following diagram.\nVerticals and Vertical IDs\nA vertical is a group that defines the nature of the business. An org can have multiple verticals mapped to it.\nFor example, if an org ABC sells fitness items and apparel, and another org XYZ sells stationery and sports items, both orgs have one common vertical – sports.\nFollowing are the properties of verticals:\nEach vertical is mapped to the relevant set of extended fields\nThe vertical name should be unique across the table\nMapping Extended Fields and Vertical Ids\nFollowing are the properties of extended fields and vertical ids mapping:\nEach extended field can only be mapped to one vertical id\nOne vertical id can be mapped to multiple extended fields\nAn extended field with vertical id ‘-1’ is available for all the orgs. These are global fields and can be used by any org\nMapping Vertical IDs and Org\nFollowing are the properties of vertical ids and org ids mapping table\nOrg and verticals have a many-to-many mapping\nAn org cannot use an extended field that is not within the verticals associated with it.\nAny org can use extended fields with the vertical id ‘-1’ ( fields)\nValidation Rules\nA validation rule can contain a logical or regex expression that evaluates the extended field values. Validation rules verify whether a field value meets the defined standards before saving it to the Mongo DB.\nThat is, If a rule is applied on an extended field, a validation check is performed whenever the field value is received. Once the field value is validated successfully, it will be saved to the Mongo DB.\nExamples for logical rules: >, <, >=, <=, =\nWe first create rules (>, <) and then map each rule to the extended fields. Following are the properties of validation rules:\nMultiple rules can be applied to an extended field\nOne rule can be applied to different fields\nOther Validations\nApart from the rules validation, scope validation is also performed which is defined in the DB tables\nExtended fields with custom enum values can be used only by orgs that are mapped to it\nAn org can use only extended fields that are mapped to it through vertical ids\nExtended fields with vertical id mapping as -1 can be used by any org\nData fields\nStandard Fields\n: These are fields created for a specific module to capture basic details. This could be fields at customer level, transaction level, line-item level, coupon level and so on. Standard fields are created by Capillary and are available by default for each module.\nExtended Fields\n: Extended Fields are proposed fields to standardize input values and keys across organizations. These fields make it easier for the Development and Analytics teams to get rid of the complex data that flows into the database, through existing custom fields. Developers control the field names, data types, enum values, and scopes for the extended fields and can capture values based on rules (logical or regex expressions). See more about\nExtended fields\n.\nCustom Fields\n: As the name suggests there are custom fields that orgs need to capture for a specific module. It could be of any datatype and value. Reporting is not possible on custom field values. See more about\nCustom fields.\nExtended Fields\nExtended Fields are proposed fields to standardize input values and keys across organizations.

Example: GUID, IMEI, making changes, and so on. Extended fields are used in customer registration, profile update, transaction, and transaction line item.\nWhen an extended field is added to collect additional information, it starts accumulating data within our system. However, this data isn’t immediately visible in the user interface for audience creation.\nIf you want to build an audience using filters based on the information stored in these extended fields, you need to raise a request to the Customer Success Team to create these filters. Once implemented, you can use these filters to create audiences. For more information refer\naudience creation using filters\n.\n📘\nExtended fields are created at the backend. You can select the fields to be displayed on the UI.\nThe following are the topics discussed in this article.\nEntity Types\nSupported Entity Types: customer, regular_transaction, return_transaction, not_interested_transaction, not_interested_return_transaction, regular_lineitem, return_lineitem, not_interested_lineitem, not_interested_return_lineitem.\nData Type\nSupported Data types:  integer, string, double, date-time, standard_enum, custom_enum\ni.

These are global fields and can be used by any org\nMapping Vertical IDs and Org\nFollowing are the properties of vertical ids and org ids mapping table\nOrg and verticals have a many-to-many mapping\nAn org cannot use an extended field that is not within the verticals associated with it.\nAny org can use extended fields with the vertical id ‘-1’ ( fields)\nValidation Rules\nA validation rule can contain a logical or regex expression that evaluates the extended field values. Validation rules verify whether a field value meets the defined standards before saving it to the Mongo DB.\nThat is, If a rule is applied on an extended field, a validation check is performed whenever the field value is received. Once the field value is validated successfully, it will be saved to the Mongo DB.\nExamples for logical rules: >, <, >=, <=, =\nWe first create rules (>, <) and then map each rule to the extended fields. Following are the properties of validation rules:\nMultiple rules can be applied to an extended field\nOne rule can be applied to different fields\nOther Validations\nApart from the rules validation, scope validation is also performed which is defined in the DB tables\nExtended fields with custom enum values can be used only by orgs that are mapped to it\nAn org can use only extended fields that are mapped to it through vertical ids\nExtended fields with vertical id mapping as -1 can be used by any or\nUpdated\n10 months ago\nTable of Contents\nExtended Fields\nData fields\nExtended Fields"

This entity includes information about each customer, ranging from essential contact details to demographic and geographic data. In addition, It also includes information about their purchase history, behavioural activities, loyalty details, the user groups they are part of, reward and coupon details and other related information.\nWithin this framework, the source through which a customer is registered is called a customer data source. This source serves as the initial touchpoint, capturing the basic details that contribute to the making of a customer profile. Additionally, the channels available for communication with the customer are referred to as customer communication channels. These channels play a pivotal role in establishing meaningful connections and fostering effective communication with customers.\nRelated entities\nA customer entity can have information related to other entities and similarly the other entities can include customer entity information. For example, card entity, and transaction entity can include information related to customer entity and vice-versa.\nSupported objects and fields\nThe below image provides you with information about the supported objects and fields in the customer entity.\nUnderstanding data sources\nIn our system, a \"Source\" refers to the origin or system from which customer information is integrated. Each source represents a unique system, integration, or data feed.\nCustomers may be represented differently across various sources. For instance, a customer named \"Christopher\" in one source could appear as \"Christo\" in another. This discrepancy underscores the necessity for identity resolution to establish a unified and accurate view of the customer.\nData integration involves collecting information from different sources, including identifiers, subscription statuses, and email addresses. This process merges and creates a consolidated, reliable customer profile. When the system receives information from the same identifier already present but from a different source, it analyzes,\nmerges\n, and adds it to the existing customer profile under a different source.\nOn Member Care, within the customer profile, you can view all the sources from which the customer registered.\nSupported data sources\nThe entity supports the following data sources:\nFacebook\nWeb_engage\nWeChat\nInstore\nE-Commerce\nWebsite\nLine\nMobile-APp\nLinkedin\nMpush-FCM\nMapp_SDK\nOAuth_External\nUnderstanding communication channels\nA \"Communication Channel\" represents the medium through which customers receive messages. Examples include SMS, push notifications, web engagement, and POS (Point of Sale) systems.\nSome sources may act as both a source and a communication channel. For instance, WeChat not only provides customer information but also serves as a communication channel.\nCommunication channels can vary, and information may be collected from diverse sources. For instance, a customer's communication channel, such as WeChat, may exclusively come from the WeChat system.\nOverlapping scenarios may arise where the source and communication channel are the same, while in other cases, they can be different. The system is designed to handle these variations effectively.\nSupported communication channels\nThe entity supports the following communication channels:\nWeChat\nMobile\niOS\nLine\nEmail\nWhatsApp\nAndroid\nPostmail\nManaging customer lifecycle with customer status\nA customer status defines the relationship between a brand and a customer. For example, a customer who interacts often with the brand can be defined as an active customer. Further, these statuses can be used to run the loyalty program and assign coupons, reward points etc accordingly. For example, more offers can be offered to a customer to make an inactive customer to active customer..\nActivating customer status\nTo activate customer status for your organisation, navigate to\nOrganisation settings> Miscellaneous> Customer Status configuration\nand select the\nEnable customer status\ncheck box.\nOn enabling the customer status, the existing fraud status will be replaced by the customer status function.\nTypes of customer statuses\nThe various customer statuses available in the Capillary platform that you can configure are:\nActive\nSuspended\nDeleted\nFraud suspected\nFraud confirmed\nInternal\nPending deletion\nCreating a custom label\nYou can click the\nCreate new label\noption in the customer label and enter a new label name to assign a custom name for the status. You can add multiple labels if required. The first status label that you create is set as the default status value.\nActive customer status\nThe active status can be used to indicate that the customer is active.\n📘\nNOTES:\nThere are no restrictions for customers with Active status.\nAll customers are marked Active by default.\nSuspended, Fraud suspected, Fraud confirmed, and Internal customer status\nYou can restrict the following operations for the users with Suspended, Fraud suspected, Fraud confirmed or Internal status.\nRestriction\nDescription\nBlock coupons redemption\nRestrict from redeeming coupons.\nBlock issual of loyalty promotions\nRestrict from receiving points.\nBlock identifier change and account merge\nRestrict from account merging and identifier change requests.\nBlock issual of badges\nThis is a future development feature.\nBlock issual of coupons\nRestrict from providing coupons.\nBlock enrollment into loyalty promotions\nThis is a future development feature.\nBlock points allocation\nRestrict from providing points.\nWhen this restriction is added on any label, then the points allocation from any points-related action (like transaction point allocation, allocation points, target point allocation, issue to the referrer, issue to referee, goodwill points, import profile) will be blocked for the customer.\nBlock points redemption\nRestrict from redeeming points.\nBlock tier upgrade\nRestrict from tier upgrade.\nBlock transaction\nRestrict future transactions.\nMark transaction outlier\nMark the transactions made by the selected label(s) as outliers.\nTo restrict access, select the individual status labels or all the created status labels from the desired restriction drop-down. Click\nSelect\n, and then click\nUpdate\n.\nDeleted customer status\nThe deleted status allows you to block every action for customers with this status. To configure restriction, from the\nBlock everything\ndrop-down, select the individual custom labels or select all labels created for Deleted. Click\nSelect\nand then click\nUpdate\n.\nPending deletion customer status\nThis status is used to indicate the status of customers for whom a deletion request is raised. For\nPending Deletion\n, whenever a PII deletion request is triggered, a label Deletion_pending is automatically created and assigned to the customer, regardless of any other label that may have been created and set as default.\nManaging subscription\nA subscription refers to the voluntary action taken by customers to either opt in or opt out of receiving promotional or transactional communications from specific sources within the organization.\nYou can configure the promotional and transactional subscription settings for a customer according to their preferences. For more information, refer to the\nSubscription management\ndocumentation.\nYou can also view and set the subscription statuses on the customer's profile on\nMember Care\n.\nManaging loyalty status\nA customer can be of two types: a loyalty customer and a non-loyalty customer. A loyalty customer is a registered member of your organization's loyalty program, while non-loyalty customers are those who have not enrolled in your loyalty program but have subscribed using their mobile number or email ID with the organization. Transactions for these customers are tagged to their respective identifiers (mobile number/email ID).\nYou can define the loyalty type of a customer during\ncustomer registration\nor while\nadding a transaction\n.\nThe loyalty status of a customer is displayed on the\nCustomer status\nin the customer's Member Care profile.\nManaging test and control status\nThe customer list is split into a test and control group. Customers in the test audience group receive campaign communications, while those in the control audience group do not. The test and control statuses are displayed based on the group to which they belong. These statuses are maintained by the brands or auto-assigned and can be changed either through\nMember Care\nor\nConnect+\n.\nManaging fraud status\nYou can configure the fraud management and the statuses as per your requirements. For more information on fraud management, refer to the\nFraud management documentation\n.\n📘\nNote\nIf customer status is enabled, the fraud status will be superseded by the customer status.\nGetting started\nSetup customer fields\nStandard fields, Extended fields and Custom fields are the fields that are applicable for Customer entity.

When the Dual Eligibility feature is enabled, only one identifier is considered the primary identifier and the rest of the identifiers are considered for communication. The primary identifier for both of these profiles must be unique.\nExample:\nConsider a brand user who is registered on the platform using Email\n[email protected]\n, Mobile 123-456-7890, and External ID ABC123 (primary identifier). With the Dual Eligibility feature enabled, another user can be registered again using Email\n[email protected]\n, Mobile 123-456-7890, and External ID ABC124.\nNotes:\nFor the users registered with Dual Eligibility, the information about the user can be retrieved only using the primary identifier.\nIf a customer is registered with the same identifier through a different registration source, the customer gets merged with the existing user.\nEnabling dual eligibility\nTo enable dual eligibility for an organization, create a JIRA ticket to the Product Support team and enable the configuration CONF_INSTORE_V2_ENABLED.\nIn addition, make sure that the below configurations are configured as per the table:\nConfiguration Name\nConfiguration\nCONF_REGISTRATION_PRIMARY_KEY\nExternal ID or mobile or email\nCONF_REGISTRATION_PRIMARY_KEY_REQUIRED\n1 - Enable\nCONF_ALLOW_REGISTRATION_FROM_ANY_IDENTIFIERS\n0 - Disable\nCONF_USERS_IS_MOBILE_REQUIRED\n0 - Not required\nFAQs\nQ: Is dual eligibility applicable for both loyalty and non-loyalty users?\nA: Dual eligibility is applicable only for Loyalty users.\nQ: Is it applicable to all types of orgs such as connected orgs, standard orgs, and Org Units?\nA: The dual eligibility feature applies to all the orgs.\nQ: Can we migrate users with the same secondary identifiers and unique primary identifiers?\nA: Yes. You can migrate.\nQ: What happens if I register a customer with the same primary identifier and other identifiers but a different source?\nA: The customer gets merged, and on MemberCare, you will be able to see both registration sources.\nUpdated\n21 days ago\nTable of Contents\nRelated entities\nSupported objects and fields\nUnderstanding data sources\nSupported data sources\nUnderstanding communication channels\nSupported communication channels\nManaging customer lifecycle with customer status\nActivating customer status\nTypes of customer statuses\nCreating a custom label\nActive customer status\nSuspended, Fraud suspected, Fraud confirmed, and Internal customer status\nDeleted customer status\nPending deletion customer status\nManaging subscription\nManaging loyalty status\nManaging test and control status\nManaging fraud status\nGetting started\nSetup customer fields\nSetup customer configs\nExternal ID configuration\nCustomer ingestion restriction configuration\nSetup customer status\nDual eligibility\nEnabling dual eligibility\nFAQs"

Then, assign a ticket to the Platform team requesting to enable Org Units for the org.\nOnce the Org Unit (OU) is enabled for the org, you can have a user role management, loyalty program, audience filters, and reporting at the OU level.\nThis article covers the following topics.\nDefine Organization structure\n: This includes zones, concepts, store-servers, stores, and store-tills.\nOrganization Users\n: This includes registering admin users for your organization, creating user roles, and assigning user roles to define the scope of accessibility for each user to your organization's data.\nBefore starting with the organization setup, you need to understand the basic terminologies used in the hierarchy.\nConcept\n: These are a logical grouping of stores for a single brand org. For example, groceries, electronics, apparel, and home appliances; and logical separation of brands in case of multi-brand org. For example, if an org ABC is into different verticals (say a supermarket, retail, and electronics as brands), each brand can have its own account through concept hierarchy.\nThe following are the features of the Org Unit (OU).\nUsers and access management at the OU level.\nCampaign and loyalty program creation at OU level.\nReports  (Insights+) at OU level.\nView customer information at the OU level.\n📘\nCustomer registration remains the same across org. For example, a customer registered in an org unit will be registered automatically in all other org units. Hence, the registration date remains the same across org units.\nZones\n: These are a geographical grouping of stores. For example, north, south, east, and south-east.\nStore Server: It is a local server for a store. The data captured by InStore is first saved in the store-server and from there the data will sync to the main server. Tills are associated to Store Server. However, Store Server is not required for Tills with an internet connection.\nStores: These are usually the branches or outlets of an organization or you can say a physical store.\nTill/Store Till:  A Till is a POS machine where the billings happen. A store can have one or more Tills. All the tills should be connected to the store-server through LAN and hence no internet is required at the till level to sync data to the store-server. However, store-server communicates with the main server over the internet.\nThe hierarchy of an organization is as follows -\nZones > Stores (Stores can be grouped independently by zones and concepts) > Store Servers > Store Tills.\nStores are geographically grouped using zones and can also be logically grouped using the concept. Hence, a store can be for a zone or for a combination of a zone and a concept.\nOrg hierarchy\nAn org hierarchy can have up to 5 levels including Tills. In the hierarchy, Till is the lowest level and you can create other levels depending on the org structure.\nLogin to InTouch of your cluster and follow these steps.\nCreate Concept\nCreate Zone\nCreate Store\nAdd Store Server\nAdd Till\nCreate concept\nYou can use concepts for logical grouping for single-brand orgs, and as org units for multi-brand orgs. The creation process remains the same for both.\nIf you need to have concepts as org units, after creating concepts, log a ticket to enable org units for your org and assign it to the Platforms team.\n📘\nOnce the Org Unit (OU) is enabled for the org, you can have user role management, loyalty program, audience filters, and reporting at the OU level.\nTo create a concept, follow these steps.\nNavigate to\nProfile\n>\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nStore Masters\n>\nConcepts\n.\nClick\nAdd New Concept\n.\nFill in the details based on the description provided in the following table and click Submit.\nCode\n: A unique code for the zone.\nName\n: Name of the zone.\nDescription\n: Short description of the zone.\nParent Concept\n: Choose the parent concept for the concept if any. For example, if you are creating a concept Apparel, you can have sub-concepts as men apparel, kids’ apparel women apparel and so on.\n* Default Language\n: The default language used for the concept.\nDefault Currency\n: The default currency used across the concept.\nDefault Time Zone\n: The default time zone of the concept.\nSimilarly, you can create any number of concepts  required for the org.\nCreate zone\nThe following procedure guides you in creating zone hierarchy\nNavigate to\nProfile\n>\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nStore Masters\n>\nZones\n.\nClick\nAdd New Zone\n.\nFill in the fields based on the description provided in the following table and click\nCreate Zone\n.\nCode\n: Enter a unique zone code in apha-numeric.\nName\n: Enter a name for the zone. For example, North\nDescription\n: Enter a short description of the zone.\nParent Zone\n:  Tag a parent zone for child zones. For example, if you want to create the India-east zone under the India zone. Then the parent zone for India-east will be India.\nDefault Language\n: Default language that you want to associate with the zone (regional language).\nDefault Country\n: Country of the zone.\nDefault Time Zone\n: Preferred time zone.\nSimilarly, create the entire zone hierarchy for your organization.\nCreate Store\nStores are the second level from the bottom in the hierarchy. A store can be associated with a zone and concept.\nTo create a store, follow these steps.\nNavigate to\nProfile\n>\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nStore Masters\n>\nStores\n.\nClick\nAdd New Store\n.\nFill in the fields based on the description provided in the following table and click\nSubmit\n.\nStore Code\n: The store code to be identified in Capillary Cloud. It is recommended to use the following format for store code.\n.\n.\n.<POS Code/External Id of the Store>.\nStore Name\n: Name of the store you need to register.\n📘\nNote:\nThe UI does not support the addition of special characters in the store name. Special characters in the store name can only be added when adding stores using the data import option.\nStore Description\n: Short description of your store.\nParent Store\n: The parent store for the store. You can create child stores for a parent store. This option displays the list of all the stores you have registered for your organization.\nParent Concept\n: The logical group (Concept) of the store.\nStore Default Language\n: The language used at the store.\nStore Default Currency\n: The base currency at the store location (currency of the country where the store is located).\nStore Default Time Zone\n: The geographical location of the store. All the zones created for your organization is displayed in the drop-down.\nAccess Group\n: Access group to which the store has access. All the tills under the store inherit the access group of the store and will have access to the APIs accordingly.  You can also assign a default access group for all the stores under your organisation. For information on access groups, see\nAccess group\n.\nStore Code Representation for the Org\n: The external id of your brand. External ids.This should be unique and should not be a used external code.\nSet the Admin Type\n: Set this as\nGeneral\nfor a live store. If you would like to test the store before making it live, choose\nAdmin\n.\nSimilarly, you can create all the required stores for your org.\nAdd Store Server\nIn stores where PoS machines do not have access to the internet, you will have a store server that has an internet connection. All POS machines (or TILLs) are connected to the store server through LAN.\nA store will usually have one store server.\nTo add a store server, follow these steps.\nNavigate to\nProfile\n>\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nStore Masters\n>\nStore Servers\n.\nClick\nAdd New Store Server\n.\nEnter the store server details based on the description provided in the following table and click\nSubmit\n.\nStore\n: The store to which store-server needs to be configured.\nStore Server Username\n: Enter the username of the store-server provided by Capillary for that particular store.\nStore Server Password\n: Enter the password of the store server provided by the Capillary for that specific store.\nConfirm Password\n: Reenter the password of the store server.\nSimilarly, you can add all the necessary store servers required for your brand.\nAdd Till\nTILL is a PoS machine and is the last entry in the org hierarchy. Each TILL needs to be mapped to a store. You also need to map to a store server, for models where TILLs have no internet access.\nTo add a new TILL, follow these steps.\nNavigate to\nProfile\n>\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nStore Masters\n>\nStore Tills\n.\nClick\nAdd New Till\n.\nEnter TILL details based on the description provided in the following. Click\nSubmit\nto save your changes and create the Till.\nStore\n: The store to which store-till needs to be assigned.\nStore Server\n: Store Server for the till. This acts as a local server for the POS machine (Store Till).\nTill Username\n: Username of the In-Store application for that till. The username should be in lowercase, with words separated by dots (e.g., till.config.test).\nTill Password\n: The password of the In-Store application for that till.\nConfirm Password\n: Reenter the password of the In-Store.\nSimilarly, you can add all the TILLs required for the org.\nUpdated\n4 months ago\nTable of Contents\nSetup organization hierarchy\nCreate concept\nCreate zone\nCreate Store\nAdd Store Server\nAdd Till"

Set -1 if the outlier is not applicable to your organization.\nAMOUNT_ROUNDING_OFF_TO_DECIMAL_PLACES\nThis configuration specifies the number of decimal places to retain for transaction values. For example, if you set it to 2 decimal places and a transaction value is 100.567, the system will store the value as 100.56. This setting also applies to line-item transactions.\nNote:\nIf the\nDecimal Places for Base Currency\nin the\nbilling configuration\nis defined, the system always prioritizes this setting. In the above example, if\nDecimal Places for Base Currency\nis set to 1, the system will store the value as 100.6.\nAdd payment modes\nA payment mode will have attributes and attribute values.

However, sometimes, in those transactions, we might get:\nLine item that is not present in the master list\nPayment method that is not registered in the system\nStores whose details are not yet added in the capillary system\nMissing transaction extended field\nMissing customer extended field\nWhenever these situations occur, those transactions will be stopped from processing (rejected), and will be moved to a centralised sanity queue instead based on below.\nAfter this enhancement, the handling will be as below:\nIf they are of 1st, 2nd, 3rd type, they will be moved to the sanity queue.\nIf they are of 4rth, 5th type:\nIf they are of enum (basically a bunch of options), they will be moved to the sanity queue.\nFor all the other types, they will be marked as failed permanently.\nRemember, all these transactions will be marked either as “pending” or “failed” as per above flow. All these configurations need to be enabled by the brands, otherwise the system will default to current behavior.\nOnce these transitions are moved to the sanity queue, an event notification will be sent to the respective brands notifying them that we have received these types of transactions. Brands can fetch these transactions from APIs too to check about them as per their policies (daily, weekly, etc..)\nIn the event notification that will be sent to brands, it contains following information:\nEvent name\nEvent datetime\nBill number\nCustomer identifier\nRejection type, .i.e., can be reprocessed or not\nReason of the rejection\nSource details of the bill\nBrands can get these transactions from API  based on:\nRejection type\nAll pending transactions for a customer\nThen brands need to provide the new data points (new line items, new payment methods, new store, new extended field values) that can be considered for transactions to Capillary. Once they are updated in the Capillary system, all these transactions in the sanity queue will be re-processed once again by our capillary system.\nDuring the reprocessing, the process will happen based on the processed date not the original bill date. The APIs involved in this entire sanity queue are following:\ngetRejectedTransactions: Fetches all the rejected transactions for the org, based on the input query params.\nretriggerTransactionAdd: Checks and updates the status of rejected Transaction. Retriggers the transaction add for  the rejected transaction  which are completely fixed.\nmarkFailed: Updates the rejected transaction status to PERMANENT_FAILED\ngetReTriggerStatus: Gives the status of retriggered rejected transactions for the given retrigger Id\nAPI links will be available here:\nhttps://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/getrejectedtransactions\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago"

Behavioural Event is a platform that lets you create standard and custom events to capture customer activities across channels. After you create an event, whenever it is triggered, the payload containing the defined attribute information is sent to the webhook. The Behavioral Event framework listens to this event, validates it, and sends it to the corresponding destination such as loyalty, journey, etc.\nObjective\nThe Behavioral Events data collected across sources can be used to develop personalized content, segment customers, or even incentivize customers.\nThis product solves different use cases for different verticals.\nFor example:\nIn an offline retail or brick-and-mortar store, you can send coupons to customers for different events such as scanning a QR code of a particular product category, or showing interest in a particular item.  This increases conversion without customers visiting the store again.\nIn an e-commerce platform (website or app), customers can be engaged through games or quizzes.\nIn the healthcare domain, customers can be rewarded for completing health-related activities to drive better engagement and loyalty of the customers.\nIn Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG), customers can be rewarded for participating in sales promotion events.\nIn the case of hospitality, you can send tailored messages to customers based on the stage of their purchase cycles such as inquiry, booking, check-in, and checkout.\nModules that consume Behavioral Events\nCurrently, events data can be consumed by Insights+ and Loyalty+. By default, Insights+ consumes any event that you create on Behavioral Events. However, you need to manually set if you want to consume by Loyalty+.\nLoyalty+\n: This includes both loyalty and DVS (Dynamic Voucher System).\nConsumed by\nLoyalty Manager\nto send messages to customers or incentivize them based on events data. For example, you could send a message when a product a customer is looking for is of limited stock.\nConsumed by\nBounceback Campaign\nto run engagement programs based on the events data. For example, you could send discount coupons on product abandonment or product add-to-cart events.\nInsights+ (upcoming feature) to analyze events data. For example, most searched products frequently searched products during a festival season.\nTypes of Behavioral Events\nThe following are two types of Behavioral Events available.\nStandard Events (Library of predefined events)\n: These are predefined events with all the required attributes and values. The following is the list of standard events. Administrators can enable events that are required for an organization.\nProduct Removed From Cart, Customer Logged Out, App Installed, Product Added To Cart, Customer Registered, Category Viewed, Product Viewed, Customer Logged In, Coupon Applied, Product Searched, Coupon Denied, and App Uninstalled.\nCustom Events\n: If you want to capture a specific customer activity other than in Standard Events, you can create custom events with the event names, attributes, and values.\nThe following table provides an understanding of choosing between standard and custom events.\nSCENARIO\nSTANDARD EVENTS\nCUSTOM EVENTS\nAdd standard attributes (such as SKU and Till) before publishing\nNo\nYes\nEdit standard attributes before publish\nNo\nYes\nDelete standard attributes before publishing\nNo\nYes\nAdd standard attributes (such as SKU and Till) after publishing\nNo\nNo\nEdit standard attributes after publishing\nNo\nNo\nDelete standard attributes after publishing\nNo\nNo\nAdd custom attributes (string, enum, double, date) before publishing\nYes\nYes\nEdit custom attributes before publishing\nYes\nYes\nDelete custom attributes before publishing\nYes\nYes\nEdit custom attributes after publishing\nNo\nNo\nDelete custom attributes after publishing\nNo\nNo\nAdd custom attributes (string, enum, double, date) before publishing\nYes\nYes\nNew terminologies\nWebhook\nEnables syncing and relaying data between third-party applications and the Capillary Server facilitating automated calls and real-time updates.\nWebEngage\nMulti-channel user engagement platform that lets you automate communications.\nTransformer\nUsed to convert the payload sent by the third-party app to a payload understood by Capillary. In simple terms, it is a field mapping.\nWebhook Adapter\nUsed to track real-time events data that consists of payload understandable by the Capillary system.\nIntegration\nAutomates pushing event data from a third-party app or website to the Capillary system. There are two types of integrations-\nWebEngage to integrate Capillary Behavioural Events platform with WebEngage.\nCustom integration to integrate Capillary Behavioural Events platform to any other third-party apps.\nSource Account\nSource in which a customer is registered. Example: Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, InStore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, Ecommerce, Website, and Line.\nEvent and Attribute\nEvent is customer activity such as logging out, adding items to cart, and so on. Whereas, attributes are entries of an event that needs to be captured by our system. For example, for the event product review, you could have attributes like title and review message body.\nStandard Event\nA predefined event with a defined set of attributes.\nCustom Event\nA user-defined event that lets you define your own attributes that you want to capture.\nStandard Attributes\nThe standard attribute in a behavioural event system is a default attribute that will be applicable for all the events. There are two standard attributes,\neventDateTime\nand\nstoreUnitID\n. These attributes need not be defined during the creation of an event and are applicable for all events by default.\nstoreUnitID\n- This attribute is used only for internal usage.\neventDateTime\n- This is a standard attribute that captures the event processing time. If a value is sent for the\neventDateTime\nattribute, such as 2024-03-24 12:00:00, it serves as the timestamp for the event. However, if no value is sent or the attribute is missing in the payload, the time of event processing becomes the event timestamp.\nThe formats that are acceptable for the eventDateTime attribute are given below:\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:s.S\nyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\nyyyy-MM-dd\ndd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss\nMM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss\nyyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss\nyyyy/MM/dd\ndd-MM-yyyy\nMM/dd/yyyy\nyyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss\ndd-MMM-yy\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss\nEEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy\nMMMM,dd,yyyy\nMMMM,dd\nyyyy-dd-MM HH:mm:ss\n📘\nNote\nThe Behavioural event system saves the value for the eventDateTime attribute in the system as is, without any timezone offset. If there is no value provided for the attribute, it processes the time according to the GMT timezone and saves the datetime value without the timezone offset.\nCustom Attributes\nThe custom attributes are user-defined attributes for each event. You can define attributes such as customer ID, product code, booking ID, product category, etc., and map the fields to capture the corresponding information. For example, you can create an attribute named\nCustomerMobileNumber\nand map it to Customer ID > Mobile number.\nThese attributes can be of any of the following data types:\nEnum\nGroup ID\nTill Code\nCoupon Code\nCustomer ID\nDate\nProduct SKU\nProduct Brand\nCurrency Code\nProduct Category\nString\nDouble\nEvent Handling in Connected Orgs Using Custom Attributes\nUse Case\nA company has developed a health activity tracker mobile app used by employees across multiple organizations. The app logs behavioural events and rewards employees through both their employers and the company itself.\nCustom Attribute in the Event Payload\nSample Payload:\nSample payload\n{\n  \"event_flag\": 5.19,\n  \"event_name\": \"clickEventPromoPoint\",\n  \"identifier_value\": \"unionId918871834592\",\n  \"eventDateTime\": \"2023-12-11 12:13:14\",\n  \"orgResolver\": {\n    \"type\": \"PARENT_CHILD_ORG\",\n    \"childOrgId\": 1115,\n    \"tillCode\": \"12342\"\n  }\n}\nMapping\nAlso called attribute mapping that lets you map attributes of a behavioural event with the attributes of a third-party application.\nLimitations of Behavioral Events\nThe following are the limitations of Behavioral Events.\nNo support for standard entities such as SKU, and category in filters and KPIs for custom events.\nNo support for anonymous events, customer identifier is required.\nData is captured only from predefined integrations (such as WebEngage or Webhook), and not directly from sources (such as eCommerce websites, apps, and WeChat).\nThe platform registers customers from the registered user profiles data shared in the S3 bucket. If there is no WebEngage integration, customer registration needs to handle through API Integration.\nLimitations for Custom Events:\nA maximum of 10 active events are allowed in an org.\nA maximum of 20 attributes are allowed in an event.\nCustom attribute names can have only up to 50 characters.\nCustom attributes can have only enum, date, Boolean, integer, double, and string as data types.\nSteps to configure and publish an event\nCreate a Webhook integration for a WebEngage platform or any other third-party apps or platforms.\nCreate a new custom event or add a standard event.\nCreate attribute mapping.\nRun a sample test to validate whether the data is flowing correctly as desired.\nPublish the event.\nAdd Webhook Integration\nWebhook facilitates pushing real-time data from a third-party application or website to the Capillary database through a web callback or HTTP push API. A Webhook integration is a combination of a third-party app and Till code. For every Webhook integration you create, a unique URL is generated. The respective third-party apps need to make a POST call to the URL passing events data.\nThere are two types of integrations\nWebEngage integration\nto capture events data from the WebEngage platform.\nCustom integration\nto capture events data from other platforms or apps other than WebEngage.\nTo create a Webhook integration, follow these steps.\nClick\nCreate Webhook\n.\nChoose WebEngage for WebEngage integration, else choose Custom for integration with other apps.\nIn\nSelect till code\n, choose the Till code that you want to associate with the selected source. If an event has the attribute\nTill Code\n, then the Till Code that is captured for the event will be considered as a default one.\nClick\nDone\nYou need to use the integration URL to POST event data to Webhook through an API call.\n📘\nIf an event has the Till Code attribute, then the till code tagged in the Webhook or any other integration will not be considered.\nAdd & map custom event\nCreate custom events if you want to capture specific details that are not available in standard events. You can use both standard and custom attributes to create custom events.\nThe following are the steps involved in publishing a custom event.\nTo create a custom event, follow these steps.\nLog on to InTouch\nGo to >\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nData Model\n>\nBehavioral Events\n.\nClick +\nAdd Events.\nClick\nCreate New Event\nand follow these steps\nIn\nEvent Name\n, specify a name for the event without any space or special characters (except underscore). For example, DemoEvent. If there are spaces in the event name, the system automatically replaces the spaces with a double underscore. Hence, do not use double underscores while naming the event.\nIn\nDisplay Name\n, specify a name that you want to be displayed.\nIn\nDescription\n, give a short description of the event.\nClick +\nAdd Attribute\nto add event attributes and follow these steps.\nIn\nName\n, specify an appropriate name for the attribute.\nCustomer Identifier is a mandatory attribute for a custom event\n.\nIn\nData Type\n, choose the type of the attribute.\nTYPE\nDESCRIPTION\nCUSTOMER IDENTIFIER*\n(MANDATORY)\nThis is a mandatory attribute for an event and is used to identify an existing customer and also to register a new customer if required.\nYou need to configure identifier type, source, and associated source account.\n_\nCustomer Identifier\n: Choose the identifier type from the available options - Mobile number, email ID, external id, WeChat ID, userId, Martjack ID.\n_\nSource\n: Choose the source from which you want to identify customers. Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, Instore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, e-Commerce, Website, Line, and other sources.\n_\nSource Account\n: For sources with multiple accounts, such as WeChat or Facebook, choose the desired account to identify registered customers from that source account.\n_\nAdd customer if not available\n: Enable this option to automatically register new customers (in the loyalty program) that are captured through the event.\nFor example, if you set customer identifier as email ID, and Source as InStore,\n_ when an email id that is already registered on InStore is identified, the data is tagged to the customer and saved in the Capillary system\n_ when a new email id identified, the customer will be first registered\nif Add customer id not already present\nis enabled. The event details are tagged to the customer before saving the data.\nEnum\nChoose this to capture the predefined values for the attribute. In POSSIBLE VALUES enter the supported values for the field separating each by a comma (do not leave space after a comma). For example, if Name is Hobby, you could have the values Music, Sports, Fishing, Archery, Gardening, Others.\nEnum is a data type consisting of a set of predefined values.\nTill Code\nChoose this to capture Till codes.\nCoupon Code\nChoose this to capture coupon codes and configure the Regex (regular expression) for coupon codes accordingly.\nA customer identifier attribute is required for any custom event.\nChoose this to capture customer identifiers, associated sources, and source accounts from which the event is triggered.\nNOTE\n: Customer Identifier capturing is mandatory for custom events. You cannot save an event without this attribute.\nCUSTOMER IDENTIFIER\n: Mobile number, email ID, external id, WeChat ID, Martjack ID.\nSOURCE\n: Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, Instore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, e-Commerce, Website, Line, and other sources.\nSOURCE ACCOUNT\n: For sources with multiple accounts such as WeChat and Facebook, choose the account that you want to associate with the attribute.\nADD CUSTOMER IF NOT AVAILABLE\n: Enable this option to automatically register new customers (in the loyalty program) that are captured through the event.\nDate\nChoose this to capture date values. The following are the different date formats supported.\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:s.S, yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, yyyy-MM-dd, dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss,\nMM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss, yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss, yyyy/MM/dd, dd-MM-yyyy, MM/dd/yyyy, yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss, dd-MMM-yy, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss, EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy, MMMM,dd,yyyy, MMMM,dd, and yyyy-dd-MM HH:mm:ss.\nProduct SKU\nChoose this to capture product SKUs or item codes.\nProduct Brand\nChoose this to capture product brands.\nProduct Category\nChoose this to capture product categories.\nString\nChoose this to capture free-flowing text that could contain alphabets, numbers, and spaces.\nDouble\nChoose this to capture a double data type.\nDouble is a 64-bit floating value with precision up to 15 decimal places\n.\nEnable Required if the attribute is a required field for the event.\nEnable\nIs part of unique key\n, if you want the attribute to be a part of unique key. For information on uniqueness check, see\nEvent uniqueness check\n. Any attribute that is made as part of the unique key, cannot be reverted to a non-unique field.\nEnable\nIs PSI data\n, if you want to classify the attribute as sensitive data. This is applicable for attributes that are of type Enum, String, and Double. Refer to the PSI data documentation for more\ninformation on classifying PSI data\n.\nSimilarly, click\n+ Add Attribute\nto create more attributes for the event.\nClick\nNext\nto continue\nCheck\nEMF Consumer\nto show the event in Loyalty Manager, and Bounceback Campaign to reward points, coupons, or just send messages. By default, these events are consumed by Essential Insights.\nIn the\nAdd destination\npage, select the\nLoyalty\ncheck box to send the event to Loyalty and process it. If it is not selected, the event is not sent to Loyalty and will not be considered for any points, rewards or any other loyalty program. By default, the\nLoyalty check box\nis not selected. You must manually select this option to send the event to Loyalty.\nClick\nDone\nto save the event.\nTest the event to see whether data is flowing to the system as expected. For example, for the Add to Cart event, open the WebEngage portal, and try adding items to the cart. The system will automatically validate the data and complete the testing process. For detailed instructions, see Test & Publish Event.\n📘\nThe Publish button will be active only once the page is refreshed after pushing the event's data to the system. You need to refresh the page manually.\nClick Publish to publish the event.\n📘\nOnce the event is published, you cannot edit or delete either standard or custom attributes.\nAfter creating, testing, or publishing the custom event successfully you can map it with the source event. For details, refer to mapping custom events to source events.\nEnabling uniqueness check\nIn behavioural events, you can enable uniqueness checks and avoid issuing reward points for duplicate events. After the uniqueness check, duplicate events are not deleted nor does the Behavioral Event framework reject it. The EMF identifies duplicate events by checking their uniqueness. If there is a duplicate event, it is not processed. This ensures that points are not provided for duplicate events.\nUse case\nA behavioural event comes to Capillary from WebEngage and the timeout set for this request is 5 seconds at WebEngage. If Capillary fails to respond within 5 secs, WebEngage triggers the same request again. The uniqueness check enables to identify the duplicate events and avoids issuing reward points for duplicate events.\nTo enable uniqueness-check in the behavioural events, perform the following:\nEnable the uniqueness check configuration in the webhook. There is no UI to enable uniqueness check configuration in the webhook and this must be performed using the webhook API call.\nFor new orgs, use the POST call and create a webhook with uniqueness check configuration or create a webhook using UI and use PUT API call to update the webhook. For more information, see\nAdd webhook\nand\nUpdate webhook\n.\nFor existing orgs, use PUT API call and update the webhook to enable the uniqueness check.\n📘\nNotes:\nOnce enabled, you cannot disable the unique check configuration.\nOnce uniqueness check is configured for the webhook, all the events in the org should have uniqueness check enabled.\nIn the events page, use the toggle switch and add the desired attributes to unique key. You can do this using API or from the UI.  To add it from the UI,\nEnable the\nIs part of unique key\nswitch.\nBy default, the event name and customer identifier form the unique key. If an attribute is enabled, it is added as a part of the unique key with the event name and customer identifier.\nUnique key format\n: EventName\nCustomerid_Attribute1_Attribute2\n....\nUnique key\n:  md5 hash generated from combining the event name, customer identifier, and additional attributes in the EventName_Customerid_Attribute1_Attribute2 format.\nExample\nConsider the following scenario:\nEvent name:\nAppointment\nCustomer ID: 9123456789\nCustom attribute for the event:\nrefID\nIn this scenario, the unique key format is Appointment_9123456789_refID, and the unique key is 779069e41a8afde74b2c526bce59e51a, which is the MD5 hash of Appointment_9123456789_refID.\nMake sure that the\nRequired\nswitch gets enabled. The unique key attributes are marked automatically when we enable the unique key switch.\n📘\nOnce the attribute is enabled as part of the unique key, it cannot be disabled.\nBy default, the event name and customer identifier are part of the unique key and the enabled attribute is added as a part of the unique key along with the event name and customer identifier.\nMap custom event to source event\nThere are some instances where events that come to Capillary's system are not in a format supported by Capillary. For example, the Capillary does not support an event name with a blank space. Suppose an event named Promotion Viewed is coming from WebEngage (source). You need to create a custom useevent - promotionViewed (custom event name) and map it to Promotion Viewed (source event name) using the event mapping process.\nBehavioral Events lets you map a custom event to a source event.  You can do it at any phase - after creating, testing, or publishing a custom event. You can map the source event name and attributes to a custom event name and attributes stored in Capillary's system.\nThe following are the different stages of event publishing when you can map a custom event to a source event.\nCreate custom event\nTo create a custom event, follow these steps.\nNavigate to\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nData Model\n>\nBehavioral Events.\nIn the\nAll Events\ntab, click + Add Event\nOn the\nAdd Events\npage, click +\nCreate New Event\nto create, test, and publish a custom event with attributes.\nMap custom events and their attributes\nTo map a custom event to a source event, follow these steps.\nNavigate to\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nData Model\n>\nBehavioral Events.\nIn the\nAll Events\ntab, search the existing or newly created custom event using the event name.\nClick +\nAdd Mapping\nto map the custom event with the source event.\nOn the\nAdd Mapping\npage, choose the source (For example, WebEngage or Custom). Once you save mapping details, you cannot change the source.\nIn\nEvent Name\n, enter the event name of the source to map to the custom event name.\nEnter the source's event attribute to map the custom event and the source event attributes.\nClick\nSave\n.\nView and modify a custom event\nTo view and edit mapping, follow these steps.\nNavigate to\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nData Model\n>\nBehavioral Events.\nIn the\nAll Events\ntab, search your preferred custom event using the event name.\nClick on the mapped custom event and navigate to the\nMappings\ntab to view the event mapping.\nNavigate to the\nMappings\ntab, click the\nEdit\nicon.\nModify the mapping as You can modify the event name and event attributes - the event name and source attributes. The system does not allow to change the source.\nClick\nSave\n.\nAdd a Standard Event\nIn\nSource\n, select the source of the event. For now, only WebEngage is supported.\nIn\nEvent Name,\nspecify your preferred name for the event.\nIn Attributes, enter the name of each attribute as in the Source(WebEngage). The attributes on the left refer to the names as in the Capillary system.\nTest the event to see whether data is flowing to the system or not. For example, for the Add to Cart event, open the WebEngage portal, and try adding items to the cart. The system will automatically validate the data and complete the testing process.\n📘\nThe Publish button will be active only once the page is refreshed after pushing the event's data to the system. You need to refresh the page manually.\nClick\nPublish\nto publish the event\nTest & Publish Event\nBy default, an event that is created will be in draft mode. Once the event is tested successfully and if the data is flowing as desired, you can publish the event to make it live.\nFor testing an event, you need to either pass the data in the supported format or in the code from where you want to implement or through API.\nTest event data using API\nBelow is the flow chart showing the steps involved in testing an event.\nHere are the steps to test an event using API.\nOn the Behavioral Events home page, in the\nAll Events\ntab, search for the event that needs testing and click on the event name.\nThe events attribute page opens.\nOn the event attributes page, go to the\n{ } Code\ntab. Copy the payload of the event.\nOpen an editor like Notepad to edit the payload. Fill in the correct values of the fields.\nThis payload is used as the request payload to Post Event API.\nOn the Behavioral Events home page, go to the\nWebhook\ntab and\ncreate a new custom Webhook\nor copy the URL of an existing custom Webhook.\n📘\nNote\nCreate a custom Webhook URL. When selecting the integration under the\nSelect Integration\ndrop-down, choose\nCustom\n.\nPOST the event\nusing the webhook URL and the event payload.\nValidate if the data flow of the event is successful using the\nGet Events Logs\nAPI.\nThe message and status fields indicate if the POST call was a success.\nRefresh the Behavioral Events home page.  The status changes from Testing Pending to Publish.\nClick\nPublish\nto publish the event.\nValidate event publishing in Member Care UI.\nFrom the customer home page, navigate to\nEvents\n>\nBehavioral events\nto see the event published.\nTimezone in behavioural events\nScenario 1: Behavioural Event payload without `eventDateTime` value.\nDescription:\nThe system processes event times using GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). For instance, if an event is logged at 6 PM IST (Indian Standard Time), the system records the processing time as 12:30 PM GMT.\nScenario 2: Behavioural Event payload with eventDateTime  `eventDateTime` value\nDescription:\nThe system considers the date mentioned by the user in the specified format. This can be used in scenarios where you want to capture a past-dated event.\nExample:\nFor example,\n2024-08-05T14:30:5.3\nif the date format is\nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:s.S\nReporting\nBehavioural events created within the system are automatically onboarded into the Insights database once the data is pushed into the event. After an organization is onboarded to the automated Behavioral Events (BE) flow, the data corresponding to all the BEs will be available for reporting within 24 hours after completion of ETL sync. This would allow the users to create normal charts and migration charts powered on BE data.\nAudience Filters\nAs soon as a behavioural event is created and its data is available in Insights, an audience filter is available in Engage+ for segregating users and creating an\naudience group\n. For more information on audience filter-based reporting, refer to the\nAudience group filter in reports\ndocumentation.\nUpdated\nabout 2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nBehavioral Events Overview\nObjective\nModules that consume Behavioral Events\nTypes of Behavioral Events\nNew terminologies\nWebhook\nWebEngage\nTransformer\nWebhook Adapter\nIntegration\nEvent and Attribute\nStandard Event\nCustom Event\nStandard Attributes\nCustom Attributes\nEvent Handling in Connected Orgs Using Custom Attributes\nUse Case\nCustom Attribute in the Event Payload\nMapping\nLimitations of Behavioral Events\nSteps to configure and publish an event\nAdd Webhook Integration\nAdd & map custom event\nEnabling uniqueness check\nUse case\nMap custom event to source event\nAdd a Standard Event\nTest & Publish Event\nTimezone in behavioural events\nReporting"

For example, you can have card series for Digital and Physical Card. A card series contains information such as card series name, card type, card number configuration details, and expiry details. You can also extended fields for cards. You can either have auto-generated cards or manually generated cards.\nCard linked loyalty program: Card linked loyalty enables creating loyalty programs for each card series. This is applicable only for MLP enabled orgs. If a loyalty program is created based on card series, you cannot create another program based on zone or concept.\nFeatures\nThe following are the features of the Card Series module.\nCreate physical and digital card series for an org.\nCreate a card series\nwith either auto-generated card numbers or manually generated card numbers.\nAuto-assign card numbers to customers during registration or first transaction after card-series creation.\nManually issue cards to customers through\nmember care\nand integration platform (APIs).\nIssue one or more cards to customers from a card series.\nCreate a separate\nloyalty program for each card series\n.\nTerminologies in card module\nThere are a few terminologies that you need to know before starting card configuration.\nCard series\n: The card series represents different card types of an organization. For example. Value card, Premium card, Digital card, Physical card, and more. A card series stores information such as card series name, how to create card numbers for the card series, whether the card can expire and after how many days, and more. The following is the information stored in the card series.\nCard series name\nCard series code\nCard number generation configuration\nCard expiry configuration\nCard\n: This represents a card from a card series issued to a customer. A card stores information such as when the card was issued, when will it expire, from which store or source account the card was issued, and more. A customer can have multiple cards of the same card series. The following information is stored at the card level.\nCard expiry date\nCard issue date\nCard status\nStore code (where the card is registered)\nCard status\n: A card has a system-defined status code and a user-defined status label. Internal validations and out-of-box functionalities such as card-related KPIs use status codes and status labels. It also allows following different naming conventions to define card statuses. You can map multiple status labels to a status code. The system supports the following status codes.\nNOT_ISSUED\n:  This card is not issued to any customer\nACTIVE\n:  The card is in an active status.\nSUSPENDED\n: The card is temporarily blocked but you can reactivate it. If the card number is used as an identifier, you cannot make any transaction or redeem points and vouchers using the card in this status.\nDELETED\n: You can modify nothing in a card with this status. You cannot use this card in transactions, points, or voucher redemption.\nEXPIRED\n: You cannot use this card in transactions, points, or voucher redemption. You cannot change the status as well.\nThe following are examples of status labels.\nCard Assigned status label mapped to ACTIVE status code\nCard Blocked status label mapped to SUSPENDED status code.\nNew Card status label mapped to NOT_ISSUED status code.\nCard Generated Card Printed and Card Distributed to Store’ multiple status labels mapped to NOT_ISSUED status code.\nCard Permanently Deleted’ status label mapped to DELETED status code.\nCard Expired status label mapped to EXPIRED status code.\nCard issue\n: Card issue means linking cards to customers. The following are the three possible scenarios that can happen during registration or post-registration. For details, see\nissue card to a customer\nA digital or virtual card is issued to the customer.\nA physical card generated in Capillary is issued to the customer.\nA physical card not generated in Capillary is issued to the customer.\nCard configurations (Org level)\nYou need to configure the following card-related settings before creating the card series.\nMap standard status with preferred status labels.\nCreate multiple status labels for each standard status.\nSet the maximum number of cards issued to a customer.\nTo configure the card at the org level, follow these steps.\nNavigate to\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMiscellaneous\n>\nCard Configurations\n.\nClick\nModify global settings\nIn the\nMaximum no. of active cards per customer\n, enter the value to set the maximum number of cards (total number of card series) for a customer.\nIn\nStatus Mapping\n, tag standard statuses to your preferred statuses (custom status labels). There are five different standard statuses - Not issued, Active, Inactive, Deleted, and Expired.\nTo create and map a status label, follow these steps.\na. Navigate to a status for which you want to add a custom status label.\nb. Click\nCreate a new tag\nc. Enter a\nname\nfor the status label.\n📘\nOnce the tag(status label) is created and saved you cannot edit or delete the tag.\nd. Click on the newly created tag to make it the default tag. If only one tag(status label) is created for a status code, the system considers this tag as the default status tag.\nClick\nUpdate\n.\n📘\nAfter successfully configuring the card at the org level,\ncreate a card series\n,\ngenerate card numbers\n, and\nissue cards to customers\n.\nCounting Only Active Cards for Customer Limits\nTo count only cards labeled as ACTIVE towards a customer's card limit, you can enable the configuration CONF_COUNT_ONLY_ACTIVE_LABEL_CARD. Once enabled, only cards marked as ACTIVE will count towards the limit, while cards with statuses such as SUSPENDED or ISSUED will be ignored.\nBy default this configuration is disabled.\nTo enable the Configuration\n, raise a JIRA request to the Product Support team requesting activation of CONF_COUNT_ONLY_ACTIVE_LABEL_CARDS.\n📘\nNote\nOrg Level: The system will count only cards labeled as ACTIVE when enforcing the maximum card limit for a customer.\nCard Series Level: Similarly, only ACTIVE cards will be counted when determining the limit within a card series.\nWhen merging two customer profiles, the system will count only ACTIVE cards from both profiles.\nUse case - A customer’s card limit is set to 5.\nWhen Configuration Disabled:\nThe system counted ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, and ISSUED cards. If the customer had 3 ACTIVE, 1 SUSPENDED, and 1 ISSUED card, the system considered the total as 5, preventing additional card issuance.\nWhen configuration Enabled\nOnly ACTIVE cards are counted. The customer now has 3 ACTIVE cards, so they can receive 2 more ACTIVE cards.\nPrerequisite\nBefore configuring the card series, you need to set an\norg-related card configuration\n.\nCreate card series\nTo create a card series, follow these steps.\nNavigate to\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMiscellaneous\n>\nCard Configurations\nSelect the\nCards\ntab.\nClick\nCreate card series\n.\nIn\nName\n, enter the name of the card series.\nIn\nSeries code\n, enter a unique series code.

The loyalty benefits such as points balance, earning rules, redemption rules, and tiers - are associated with a loyalty card (and not a country).\nMulti-Currency and Multi-Country Programs\nFields\nDescription\nBill Amount\nCaptures in local currency and uses conversion ratio for local-to-base currency conversion.\nBill Amount in Loyalty\nCaptures only in base currency.\nPoints Earning\nPoints on a bill amount in on the base currency.\nUpgrade on Amount\nEarning of points/bill amount in base currency or based on the custom field of bill amount in local currency.\nPoints Redemption across Programs\nSingle redemption across programs with single points-to-currency conversion (upcoming)\nPoints Redemption Discount\nCurrency is not applicable for points discount.\nTo configure and create loyalty programs for multi-brand orgs, follow these steps\n-\nLog on to InTouch and go to the Loyalty tab. You will see existing programs and an option to create a new program.\nClick\n+Loyalty Program\n. MLP workflow can be broadly categorized into the following three phases.\nStep 1: MLP Configuration\nPlease note that there should be no overlap between any two programs.\nYou can define the boundaries of a loyalty program either by a zone or concept hierarchy.  If a loyalty program is defined on a concept basis, then all events originating from all tills of that concept will pass through its configured program.\nDefault Program\n: A default program is created when we create an org in our system. All concepts and zones are mapped to the default program irrespective a separate program is running for that concept/zone.\nStep 2: Events\nFor any event such as transaction and customer update, first, the relevant programs will be identified and then the configured rules and actions will be executed for that particular program.\n📘\nThe default program will always be executed. If the event also matches with any other non-default program, that will also be executed\nStep 3: Get Details (API Call)\nWhenever any information such as Current points, tier, and a bulk call is required, either the calling module will pass the corresponding program or the system will identify the corresponding program from the configuration and pass the relevant value to the caller.\nUse Cases\nPoints Allocation Strategy\n: Each program has its own points allocation strategies. A point allocation strategy can be created and used within a program. The allocation strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even within the Default Program. To know how to create Points Allocation Strategies, click here.\nPoints Expiry strategy\n: Each program has its own points expiry strategy. A point expiry strategy can be created and used within a program. The expiry strategy of one point cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. To know how to create Point Expiry Strategy, click here.\nPoints Redemption Strategy\n: Each program has its own points redemption strategy and points to currency conversion ratio. The redemption strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. Points redemption strategies can be created and used within a program. To know how to create point redemption strategies, click here.\nWhile making redemption, the caller has to specify from which program and how much point needs to be redeemed. Whenever a redemption call is made and the program id is not passed, the points will deduct from the program/till where the redemption call is made.\nManage Trackers\n: Trackers created within a program can be used and evaluated within the program. It will work the same as in the case of a single loyalty program. Tracker of one program can not be used or evaluated in any other program, not even in the default program. To know more click here.\nCustomer Registration\n: Customers once registered in any program by default will register across brands in the org but the enrollment will be done only for the program to which the till belongs.  Enrollment in other brands will not happen till the customer makes a transaction in that program.\nCustomer updates\n: Customer update events will pass through all the programs which as associated with the till from where the event is fired. So if the Org wants to allocate points to a brand loyalty program or a Default program, then they have to write rules on the brand loyalty program and Default program as well.\nManage Tiers\n: Tiers for each program can be created within the program and they work within the program only. Click here to know more.\nConfigure for Transaction event\nNew Transaction\n: Once a transaction is made, the corresponding programs will be identified, and accordingly “new transactions” rules will execute.\nTransaction Update\n: Any transaction update event will only pass through the corresponding program that is configured for the till from which the update event is initiated. In case the transaction creates and transaction update tills are different then rules will run for the program where the transaction has originated.\nTransaction Return\n: For the Transaction return event, the rules will be executed from the program where the purchase was made, not where the return is made. For eg, the Customer transacted at till 1(Program 1) but return the products at till 3 (Program 2), in this case, the return rules will be executed from Program 1, not for Program 2.\nConfiguring Rules/Sets\nRule and set configuration need to be configured at the program level depending on the requirement. The rules configured for lifetime purchases, current points, no. of transactions, etc are always in the context of the program. For example, lifetime purchases are the purchases made in that program.\nFor example, let's assume a customer has made 6 transactions across the organization in different tills/stores.\nIf one writes a rule within program 1 on currentcustomer.lifetimepurchase, it will be evaluated on 1200, and on program 2 it will be evaluated on 900. Moreover, each program will have over customer KPIs such as Lifetime purchase, current points, lifetime points, trackers Visit count, and a number of transactions.\nOne View of Customer\nOne will be able to see program-wise (including Default Program) details of a customer with program-level KPIs in Member care and Binary. See the figure below. For eg, if a concept/till is not mapped in the Default program then the corresponding transaction/point will not be available in customer KPIs in Default Program.\nLimitations\nCurrently, programs can run either at concept or zone but not both\nOne concept/zone can only have one loyalty program (excluding the default program)\nPoints can only be redeemed from one program at a time.\nMultiple Loyalty programs cannot run at the store level i.e. different programs at each store of the brand\nProduct category/brand based loyalty program configurations are not available\nMultiple currencies are not supported across loyalty programs.\nUpdated\n13 days ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nFeatures\nTerminologies in card module\nCard configurations (Org level)\nCounting Only Active Cards for Customer Limits\nPrerequisite\nCreate card series\nGenerate cards\nModify Card Series\nDelete card series\nCard-based program\nUse Cases\nLimitations"

An individual can belong to multiple user groups. An org can designate different roles to these members and incentivize them according to the org’s preference. User group loyalty allows an org to incentivize not only its customers but also incentivize other business entities or individuals that contribute to their profits. It is a customer retention solution with custom group structures and includes generic loyalty mechanics which helps an org to establish brand loyalty.\nIn user group loyalty, an individual’s (member of a group) action will lead to other group members being rewarded.\nFor example, if a fleet driver fills petrol from BPCL, the manager of the fleet group can receive points for the transaction.\nThis way of incentivizing the upper management encourages other members of the group to transact from an org.\nKey concepts\nThe following are some of the key concepts of user group loyalty\nIn B2B Loyalty, an org is identified as an entity.\nAn individual can be part of multiple groups.\n📘\nYou can configure the total number of groups that a member can be part of.\nThe parent control or the admin role can be transferred from one member to another.\nPermissions to manage group benefits.\nA member of a group can still make individual transactions.\nAll the members in a group can pool in their transactions for a tier upgrade.\nPoints return and downgrade checks are supported in case of transaction return.\nBoth the group and the individual can be incentivized when they transact while representing the group.\nDifference between B2B and B2C\nThe existing user group programs (B2C or friends and family programs) only cater to customers and include family members and friends of these customers. These groups have a primary member who can redeem points and secondary members as well. In the B2C model, with the help of the Engage+ platform, orgs are able to directly benefit the primary member of the group, ignoring the secondary members. B2C model has only one primary member with multiple secondary associated.\nThe B2B user group programs aim to involve all members in the group actively by incentivizing everyone based on their roles in the group. B2B user group programs also include all the functionalities of the existing B2C programs.\nUse Cases\nFollowing are the different scenarios where user group loyalty is applicable for both B2B and B2C scenarios.\nB2B Loyalty\nVertical\nDescription\nFleet Loyalty\nFuel Brands can enroll fleet companies in their B2B loyalty programs. Fleet Drivers can earn loyalty points by purchasing fuel at retail outlets but points redemption can happen by fleet owners who are in the same group as the driver.\nCorporate Loyalty Programs\nPoints earned by an employee of a company enrolled in a B2B loyalty program can be redeemed at the company level where other members of the company will also enjoy the benefits of the transaction made by a particular employee.\nCPG and Distributor Loyalty Programs\nA sales structure where existing distributors can recruit new distributors to sell the products. Distributors make money through a percentage of their recruits' sales and also direct sales of products to customers.\nAffiliate Marketing Programs\nThe affiliate enrolled in the program can make customers buy products. With a product purchased by the customer, the rewards are accrued to the affiliate's account.\nB2C Loyalty\nVertical\nDescription\nHospitality and Restaurants\nHotel chains and restaurants where repeat customers drive significant value and family group engagement is very high can leverage this structure to boost profit and to drive stickiness.\nRetail\nRetail brands such as apparel, beauty, etc. can incentivize customers to engage with the brand as a group of friends or as a family to accrue benefits together in an accelerated fashion to get better returns.\nHealthcare\nHospitals and pharmacy chains can provide benefits to the entire family as part of insurance tie-ups and subscriptions.\nAirports and Airlines\nAirline Miles and other benefits such as lounge access and class upgrades can be provided to the entire family group.\nNew Terminologies\n1.\nCompany\n: Any business entity which is enrolled in the brand’s B2B loyalty program.\nSub-company\n: A smaller business entity associated with a Company. For example, a big company like Tata can be registered as a company while Tata Motors, TCS can be registered as sub-companies.\nCustomer Role\n: Role is used to capture the association between customer and company. A company can have customers in various roles. For example, a company enrolled in a fleet loyalty program of a brand can have customers in various roles like a driver, associate, owner, etc.\n3.\nCustomer Hierarchy\n: Customer hierarchy is used to capture the association between two customer roles. To know how to create hierarchy using APIs, see\nHierarchy\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nKey concepts\nDifference between B2B and B2C\nUse Cases\nNew Terminologies"

An individual can belong to multiple user groups. An org can designate different roles to these members and incentivize them according to the org’s preference. User group loyalty allows an org to incentivize not only its customers but also incentivize other business entities or individuals that contribute to their profits. It is a customer retention solution with custom group structures and includes generic loyalty mechanics which helps an org to establish brand loyalty.\nConfiguring Hierarchy\nCustomer hierarchy is used to capture the association between two customer roles. Hierarchy definition stores the required attributes for hierarchy creation (such as customer roles), validation rules for each role, group automation, and role-based loyalty permissions. An org can create multiple hierarchy definitions to capture its client companies’ organizational structures. Each company can have only one hierarchy. Once the hierarchy is set up, all the attributes and configurations created in the hierarchy will apply to the customers associated with the company.\nTo create a new hierarchy, do the following.\n📘\nYou can only add new roles and validation rules but cannot modify existing roles and rules.\nOn\nInTouch\n, navigate to\nOrganisation Settings > Hierarchy Configuration\n.\nClick\nNew hierarchy definition\n.\nIn\nHierarchy definition name\n, enter a customized name for the hierarchy.\nIn\nHierarchy definition code\n, enter a unique code for the hierarchy identification.\n📘\nYou cannot change an existing Hierarchy Definition Code.\nClick\nNext\n.\nIn\nRoles\n, add all the relevant user roles in the hierarchy.\n📘\nAt least two user roles are required to create a hierarchy and can extend up to eight roles.\nIn\nValidation rules\n, define the association between two roles to maintain the hierarchical structure.\n📘\nEnable Skip role mapping allowed to allow skip level associations. For example, in a company, an associate can report to a zonal manager in the absence of the city manager. If disabled, hierarchy rules are strictly followed, and skip level associations are not possible.\nA user in the Child role can be associated with the user in the Parent role.\nMax no. of child customers, the maximum value that you can enter is 30,000.\n📘\nYou can set up multiple associations by adding rules. A role can be configured as a parent role in only 1 rule. Similarly, a role can be a child role for only 1 rule. The same role cannot act as both parent and child roles.\nIn\nGroup Automation\n, Enable group automation to create groups implicitly.\nIn Group creation based on, select the role on which the group is created. This role becomes the owner/admin of the group.\nEnable Automated member addition to automatically add all users associated with the admin to the group automatically.\n📘\nYou can create only one rule with automatic member addition.\nIn\nGroup Permissions\n, provide role-based access control on loyalty actions like points redemption and points transfer.\n📘\nYou can change Group Permissions for each role later.\nClick\nCreate\n.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nConfiguring Hierarchy"

Once it is created, you can use the field in reports and campaigns.\nHowever, the team verifies the request and decides whether to convert to the extended field.\n📘\nThe team might reject the request if the custom field is too specific and does not make general sense.\nThe platform team takes care of mapping custom field values to extended fields.\nCustom Fields\nCustom fields are columns that store special or custom information related to customers, transactions, transaction line-items, coupons, and so on. As there is no control over the field values, it is difficult to run reports on custom fields. For example, if the custom field Gender has values M, F, and MF,  it becomes difficult for an analyst to work directly on such data.\nCreate new custom fields\nOn InTouch, navigate to\nProfile\n>\nOrganization Settings\n>\nMaster Data Management\n>\nData Model\n>\nCustom Fields\n.\nThe following are different entries for which you can create custom fields.\nLoyalty registration\nLoyalty transaction\nCustomer feedback\nZone custom fields\nStore custom fields\nPoints redemption\nVoucher redemption (coupon redemption)\nCustomer advanced feedback\nCustomer preferences\nCustomer Card\nTo see the custom fields of an entry, click the respective + icon.\nTo create a new custom field, click\nAdd new custom field\n.

For example, if it is a select box, you need to enter the supported values to select.\nField Scope\nChoose the entry of the custom field from the options available.\nLoyalty registration\nLoyalty transaction\nCustomer feedback\nZone custom fields\nStore custom fields\nPoints redemption\nVoucher redemption (coupon redemption)\nCustomer advanced feedback\n- Customer preferences\nLabel\nEnter the field name to appear on the UI\nDefault Values\nEnter the values of the field in case of a selection field such as radio button, checkbox, select box, and so on.\nPosition\nSpecify the sequence order of the custom field. For example, 1 to appear in the first position of the form. This field applies to client-side applications like Instore and does not undergo any server-side validation.\nRegular Expression for verification\nConfigure regex for the field value in the case of the free text field.\nError message for Regex Failure\nEnter the error message to show in case of regex failure.\nHelp Text For The Field\nEnter the help text(more information) you want to show for the field.

You're okay with partial input. For instance, typing just part of the mobile number or a fragment of the email ID should still return relevant results.\nSolution\nYou can create a search filter with\nmobile OR email OR external ID\ncondition. This is useful when you don’t have the full details but still want to pull up the right customer profile using whatever you’ve got.\nUse Case 2: Exact Match with AND Conditions\nYou want to search for a customer using a combination of details—\nfirst name\n,\ndate of birth\n, and\ncity\n. In this case, you're doing a full search. You’ll enter the complete first name (e.g.,\nFrodo\n), the full date of birth, and the full city name (e.g.,\nMount Doom\n). No partials.\nSolution\nYou can create a search filter with\nfirst name AND date of birth AND city\n(requires exact match). This approach is ideal when you want to narrow down the results to an exact individual based on multiple known fields.\nUse Case 3: Exact Match with Optional Filter\nYou want to search for a customer using\nfirst name\n,\ndate of birth\n, and\ncity\n. These are your primary fields and require an exact match. Additionally, you want to refine the search further using the\nzip code\n—but this field is optional. If provided, it’ll narrow down the results even more.\nSearch Criteria:\nfirst name AND date of birth AND city\nzip code\n(optional)\nThis is helpful when you have most of the key information but want to add another layer to reduce ambiguity in search results.\nUse Case 4: Primary ID with Optional Filters\nYou’re looking for a specific transaction using the\ntransaction (bill) number\n. To help limit the result set—especially if multiple systems or hotels use similar formats—you can add\ncheck-out date\nand\nhotel name\nas optional filters.\nSearch Criteria:\ntransaction number\ncheck-out date\n(optional)\nhotel name\n(optional)\nUse this when the transaction ID is the main identifier, but extra filters can help isolate the right record more quickly.\nUpdated\nabout 6 hours ago\nTable of Contents\nUse Case 1: Partial Match with OR Conditions\nSolution\nUse Case 2: Exact Match with AND Conditions\nSolution\nUse Case 3: Exact Match with Optional Filter\nUse Case 4: Primary ID with Optional Filters"

Once you set the filter, you can execute the search using the\nSearch API\nto perform the search.  Internally, the framework is referred to as Cortex.\nCore Concepts\nWhat is a Search Filter?\nA\nsearch filter\nis a set of one or more indexed fields used to quickly look up data. You define which fields to search on—this setup is called the\nsearch filter\n.\nThere are two types of filters:\nAND filter\n– Returns results only when\nall\nthe conditions are met\nOR filter\n– Returns results when\nany\nof the conditions are met (available only for the\nCustomer\nentity)\nOnce the filter is set, the system knows how to query the database efficiently. You can then use the\nSearch API\nto fetch the results.\nKey Features\nDefine the fields to search on—including custom and extended fields\nSet the time range for the data you want to query\nSupports\npartial search\n(starts with) for customer records\nWorks across multiple languages\nCompatible with the\nVulcan\nUI framework (but not limited to it)\nChoose which fields appear in the search results; use\nNeo\nfor advanced customization\nUnderstanding Cardinality\nWhen creating a search filter, the system first checks the\ncardinality\nof the fields you've selected. Filters with\nhigh cardinality\nare more likely to pass validation and be activated.\nHigh Cardinality\nmeans the field (or combination of fields) has a large number of unique values. This makes it a strong candidate for indexing and searching.\nExample:\nBill number\n—each value is likely unique.\nLow Cardinality\nmeans the field has only a few unique values. These fields aren’t ideal for filtering on their own.\nExample:\nGender\n—only a handful of values like Male, Female, Other. A filter with only this field will likely fail validation.\n👉\nNote:\nCardinality is calculated based on all\nmandatory fields\nin your filter.\nThe filter must pass the\ncardinality check\nbefore it can be activated.\nSearch Filter Capabilities\nEntity\nFilter Type\nFilter Limit\nMandatory Fields Limit\nNon-mandatory Fields Limit\nSearch Operators\nHistorical Data\nCustomer\nOR\n2\n–\n–\nSTARTS_WITH\n(partial search)\n10 years (based on registration date)\nCustomer\nAND\n5\n5\n6\nEQUALS\n,\nRANGE\n(for date/datetime fields)\n10 years (based on registration date)\nTransaction\nAND\n5\n5\n6\nEQUALS\n,\nRANGE\n(for date/datetime fields)\n365 days (based on billing date)\nExample Flow\nStep 1:\nDefine Filter\nCustomer entity\nFields:\nmobile OR email OR external ID\nFilter type:\nOR\nStep 2:\nCall Search API\nEndpoint:\nv2/search/entity\nReturns customer records that match any of the fields\nUpdated\nabout 2 hours ago\nTable of Contents\nCore Concepts\nWhat is a Search Filter?\nKey Features\nUnderstanding Cardinality\nSearch Filter Capabilities\nExample Flow"

For example, if an indexed field called age has no assigned value, the system will not include those records in the search results.\nWhat is the default order for the search results?\nThe search results are returned in descending order based on the registration date. This is the time when the customer data was initially entered into the collection—not the auto-update time. Even if a record is later updated, the ordering remains based on the original registration timestamp.\nWhat happens to deleted customers (PII deletion) in search results? Are changes to customer identifiers reflected in search?\nDeleted customers (due to PII deletion) are removed from search results. When a customer identifier is changed, these changes are also reflected in the search functionality.\nHow can I perform a search?\nYou can use or integrate the\nSearch API\nto search.\nUpdated\nabout 6 hours ago"

In cases where a customer cannot access the microsite, the org staff or Capillary admins can register or update the profile information on a specific microsite through Member Care.\nThe following are the steps to register or update a customer.\nChoose the microsite on which you want to register/update a customer through Member Care.\nNavigate to the respective page and register or update a customer.\nPrerequisites\nYou need to have permission to register or update a customer on Member Care.\nThe microsite on which you want to register or update your profile should have the respective event configured.\nSet the microsite on which you want to register/update customer\nBefore proceeding, you need to set the microsite on which you want to register/update a customer through Member Care. You will see form fields configured for the microsite that you set on the Action Settings page.\nTo set the microsite on which you want to register/update a customer, follow these steps.\nOn\nMember Care\n, navigate to\nSettings\n>\nAction Settings\n.\nIn\nNew Customer\n, select the microsite that you want to use to register a customer. For example, membercareReg.\nIn\nEdit Customer\n, select the microsite that you want to use to update customer information. For example, membercareEdit.\nClick\nSave\n.\n📘\nNote:\nIn the preceding screenshot, the membercareReg and membercareEdit are the pages created using Sharingan App. Hence, the page design and form fields can differ for each microsite.\nRegister customer\nBefore registering, ensure that you have set the microsite on which you want to register.\nTo register a customer on a microsite through Member Care, follow these steps.\nNavigate to the\nNew Customer Registration\npage using any of the following processes.\nCustomer Registration page\n(directly)\n: On\nMember Care\n, click\nSearch\n>\nCustomer Registration\n.\nFrom Customer Search page\n: If you are already on the\nCustomer Search\npage, click the ⋮ icon and\nNew Customer\n.\nFrom Customer Profile page\n: If you are already on a customer's profile page, click the\nSelect Actions\ndrop-down and select\nNew Customer\n.\nIn\nNew Customer Registration\n, enter the customer details.\nThe following image shows a sample registration page of a microsite. The page design and form fields might differ for each microsite.\nIn\nName\n, enter the name of the customer.\nIn the\nEmail Address\n, enter the email ID of the customer. For example,\n[email protected]\n, where username123 is the username, capillarytech is the domain and com is the Top Level Domain (TLD).\nUsername:\nThe username portion of the email address can consist of alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) along with hyphens, underscores, plus signs, and dots.\nDomain:\nThe domain portion of the email address can consist of alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) along with hyphens, underscores, and dots.\nTLD:\nThe TLD must consist only of alphabetic characters (letters).\nWhen you enter an email id, the system changes the entered email id into the format\n<alphanumeric along with hypen, underscore, plus, dot>@<alphanumeric along with hypen, underscore, dot>.<alphabetic>\nand performs the email validation.\nIn\nExternal ID\n, enter the supported external ID of the customer (if applicable for the org).\nIn\nMobile Number\n, enter the mobile number of the customer.\nIn\nCountry\n, select the country where the customer resides using drop-down options.\nClick\nSave\n. You will see the message -\nCustomer registered successfully\n. Then, It redirects to the customer profile page.\nUpdate customer profile\nYou can modify existing customer details other than the primary identifier. However, secondary identifiers can be modified if the relevant configuration is enabled on the\nRegistration Configuration\npage.\nBefore updating a customer, set the relevant microsite page on which you want to update profile details.\nTo modify customer details on a microsite through Member Care, follow these steps.\nOn\nMember Care\n, navigate to\nSearch\n>\nCustomer\n>\nCustomer Search\n.\nSearch and open a customer profile using customer details such as\nname\n,\nmobile number\n,\nemail ID\n, and\nexternal ID\n.\nIn Select Actions, select\nEdit Customer\nusing the drop-down option\nIn\nUpdate Profile\n, modify the customer profile details.\nClick\nSave\n. You will see the message -\nProfile updated successfully\n. Then, It redirects to the customer profile page.\n📘\nNote:\nThe customer profile update will fail if the customer identifier’s value is the same as an existing customer identifier value.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nPrerequisites\nSet the microsite on which you want to register/update customer\nRegister customer\nUpdate customer profile"

The member account is deleted only after the deletion request is approved. For information on approving or rejecting a request, refer to\nManage requests\n.\nMerge Accounts\nWhen duplicate accounts of a customer can exist. you can merge those accounts into one. One account will be survived and another account will be moved\n*Surviving Account\n: The customer account that will remain to continue after merging accounts is the Surviving Account.\nDeactivating Account\n: The customer account that will be removed after merging is a deactivating account. The account *once deactivated cannot be activated again and its data cannot be retrieved. However, the entire data will be validated and moved to the surviving account.\nSettings for Account Merge Requests\nYou can configure to notify org POCs on merge requests, automatically approve merge requests without the need of the back-end team to approve it, and notify customers through SMS and email when their accounts are merged.\nOn the Member Care navigation pane, click\nSettings > ID Change Request Settings > Account\n.\nIn\nEmail these on arrival of request\n, select the org POCs that you want to notify on new merge requests.\nSet\nAuto approve\nto On to automatically approve merge requests directly.\nIn\nCommunicate change to\n, select whom to notify in case of account merge.\nCheck\nRequestor\nto notify the customer that requested for account merge.\nCheck\nSurvivor\nto notify the customer whose remains after merging.\nCheck both\nRequestor\nand\nSurvivor\nto notify both.\nTo configure SMS notification, click the\nConfigure\nbutton next to Configure SMS and create the message.

In CPS, we keep the till attribution for registration as the survivor's. The points award entry will remain connected to the till where it was originally generated. So you can achieve whatever you want.\nPromised points\nPP1\nPP2\nPP1+PP2\nThe promised points after merging will be the sum of the promised points of individual accounts.\nWhen the transaction is returned, the return will be processed.\nImported points\nIP1\nIP2\nIP1+IP2\nImported points are PACP points (Points Awarded Customer Promotions table) and will follow all the rules as mentioned in this table.\nOpening points (points of third-party)\nWe don't store third party points. Hence, the opening points scenarios are invalid.\nTill ID of points issued\nThe points issued from each TILL is retained as is while merging. There will not be any change in the TILL ID associated with each set of points.\nPoints Expiry (Expiry schedule)\nDate1\nDate2\nDate1 and Date2.\nPoints will get expired as per the expiry schedule for points earned each time, even after merging.\nFor instance, if a customer has earned 300 points for purchase and assumes that the points will get expired on Aug 1, 2014, if not redeemed. Now, the customer account is merged with another account. Then, the 300 points that are transferred to the surviving account will still get expired on Aug 1, 2014, irrespective of the merge date or any other factor.\nTracker Data\nTracker1\nTracker2\nThe trackers for both the accounts will be combined, and the tracker condition will be calculated on the final values (values in surviving account after merging).\nTier\nS1\nS2\nIf S1>S2, then S1 will be the final tier.\nIf S2>S1, then S2 will be the final tier.\n- If S1=S2, then no tier upgrade takes place.\nThe new tier will be the highest of the two tiers.\nTier Movement History\nS1\nS2\nIf S1>S2, then S1 will be the final tier, and a new record for upgrading from S2 to S1 will be created on the retaining account.\nIf S2>S1, then S2 will be the final tier. As no tier upgrade happens in the continued account, no new record will be created in his/her account.\n- If S1=S2, then no tier upgrade takes place, and hence no additional record will be created.\nIssued Rewards\nIR1\nIR2\nIR1+IR2\nThe issued rewards of the deactivating account will be transferred to the surviving account, enabling the customer to use all the rewards of both accounts.\nFor unique rewards: Each reward will be transferred and tagged as issued.\nFor common rewards: Both rewards will be merged and tagged as issued. The expiry date will be the one that has the later expiration date.\nCluster Information\nC1\nC2\nThe final customer data after merging will be recomputed and the cluster will be categorized as per the new figure.\nFor example, assume that the deactivating account is in cluster C1 and the surviving account is in cluster C2. After merging the accounts, based on the new data available cluster strategy is recalculated.\nNow, if the new result meets the strategy of the cluster C3 then the surviving account after merging will be moved to the C3 cluster.\nHowever, after merging the accounts there are chances for the customer to fall either in C1 or C2 based on the recomputed result.\nNDNC Status\nStatus1\nStatus2\nStatus1 - If the mobile number of the deactivating account retains after merging,\nStatus2 - If the mobile number of the surviving account retains after merging.\nNDNC status is specific to a mobile number. So, the NDNC status of the merged account depends on the mobile number that will continue to remain after merging.\nFor example, if the deactivating account's mobile number is retained after merging, the NDNC status will remain the same in the surviving account.\nNDNC Status (When the mobile number is a secondary identifier)\nRegistered/\nNot Registered\nNot Registered/\nRegistered\nDepending on the final mobile number considered after merging, NDNC status varies.\nFor example, if the NDNC status of the final mobile number is registered in NDNC then the same status will continue to remain.\nOpt-in Status\nWhatever the communication services the surviving account has opted-in for the same will exist even after merging.\nSubscription Status\nWhatever is the subscription status of the surviving account, same will continue to remain after merging.\nMessages\nSet of\nMessages1\nSet of\nMessages2\nSet of Messages2\nMessages or notifications will not be merged or transferred from the deactivating account to the surviving account. The only messages of the surviving account continue to exist even after merging.\nFraud Status\nReconfirmed\nConfirmed/\nMarked as Fraud/\nNot Fraud\nReconfirmed\nIf the fraud status of the deactivating account is Reconfirmed then the Fraud Status of the surviving account will change to Reconfirmed.\nFraud Status\nConfirmed/\nMarked as Fraud/\nNot Fraud\nReconfirmed\nReconfirmed\nEven though the fraud status of the deactivating account is Confirmed/Marked as Fraud/ Not Fraud the surviving account's fraud status will remain Reconfirmed.\nFraud Status\nConfirmed\nMarked as Fraud/\nNot Fraud\nConfirmed\nEven though the fraud status of surviving customer is Marked as Fraud/ Not Fraud the final status after merging will be changed Confirmed.\nFraud Status\nMarked as Fraud/\nNot Fraud\nConfirmed\nConfirmed\nIf both accounts are in confirmed status the final value after merging also remains Confirmed.\nFraud Status\nMarked as Fraud\nNot Fraud\nMarked as Fraud\nIf in any one account, the customer is marked as fraud, then the final status after merging will also be Marked as Fraud.\nFraud Status\nNot Fraud\nMarked as Fraud\nMarked as Fraud\nIf in any one account, the customer is marked as fraud then the final status after merging will also be Marked as Fraud.\nFraud Status\nReconfirmed/\nConfirmed/\nMarked as Fraud\nInternal\nInternal\nIf at least one account status is internal then the final account status will be Internal.\nFraud Status\nInternal\nConfirmed/\nMarked as Fraud\nInternal\nIf at least fraud status of merging accounts is internal then the final surviving account status will be Internal.\nCard details\nC2\nC2\nC1 & C2. The cards of the victim are transferred to the survivor's account.\nTransaction requests\nTransaction Request 1\nTransaction Request 2\nTransaction request 1 & 2. The pending transaction requests of the victim are transferred to the survivor.\n❗️\nWhen merging cards with the survivor, the application may generate warnings in the following scenarios:\nIf the total number of cards under the survivor exceeds the defined maximum number of active cards per customer for individual card types.\nIf the total number of cards under the survivor exceeds the defined maximum number of active cards based on global card settings.\nHowever, you can choose to ignore the warning and proceed with adding the cards to the survivor.\nExcluding card merging during account merge\nBy default, when merging customer accounts, the cards associated with the victim account are transferred to the survivor account automatically. In case the customer exceeds the set threshold for the maximum number of cards they can hold, the transfer of cards from a victim to a survivor account will proceed with a warning.\nHowever, if you want do not want to transfer the cards of the victim account to the survivor account during a customer merge, you can raise a ticket and disable the\nCONF_ALLOW_CARD_TRANSFER_TO_SURVIVOR\nconfiguration. This ensures that the cards are not transferred along with the other existing parameters.\n❗️\nThere is no UI to enable this configuration. You need to raise a JIRA ticket (\nsample ticket\n) to the sustenance team to enable these configurations. Turn around time is five days.\nSkipping secondary identifiers when merging user data\nYou can use the\nCONF_SKIP_SECONDARY\nconfiguration to determine whether to skip using secondary identifiers when merging user data. If enabled, the system will not use secondary identifiers when a matching user is found; instead, it will only consider the primary identifier.\nThe section below explains the scenarios when the configuration is enabled and disabled.\nTerms\nCampaign user -  An individual whose identifiers are present in Capillary's Campaign users' list, used for sending campaign messages.\nLoyalty user: An individual who is already a customer and enrolled into a loyalty program.\nIncoming transaction: An incoming transaction from a new or existing customer.\nCONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is disabled\nWhen CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is disabled, the campaign user will merge with the loyalty user based on matches with the primary identifier or any other identifier.\nExample 1:\nPrimary Identifier - Mobile\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign user\nE1\nM1\nIncoming transaction user data\nE1\nM2\nPrimary Identifier (Mobile) Match:\nThe system compares the Mobile identifiers.\nCampaign User has Mobile (M1) and the incoming request has Mobile (M2).\nMerge Decision:\nThe Campaign User's existing details (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) will be updated to Email: E1, Mobile: M2.\nDepending on the payload passed, this updated user will be considered a loyalty or non-loyalty user.\nExample 2:\nPrimary identifier - mobile\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nE1\nM1\nLoyalty User\nNULL\nM2\nIncoming transaction user data\nE1\nM2\nMatching Process:\nPrimary Identifier (Mobile) Matching:\nThe system compares the primary identifier (Mobile).\nCampaign User has Mobile: M1, but the request has Mobile: M2.\nLoyalty User has Mobile: M2, which matches with the request.\nSecondary Identifier (Email) Matching:\nIncoming user data's Email (E1) matches the Campaign User's Email (E1).\nHowever, the merge is primarily driven by the primary identifier (Mobile).\nMerge Process:\nSince CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is disabled, the merge considers both primary and secondary identifiers.\nCampaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and Loyalty User (Email: NULL, Mobile: M2) are merged.\nResult:\nCampaign user's Email remains NULL, and Mobile remains M1: Email(NULL), Mobile(M1).\nLoyalty user's Email is updated to E1, and Mobile remains M2: Email(E1), Mobile(M2).\nAfter Merging\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nNULL\nM1\nLoyalty User\nE1\nM2\n📘\nNote\nIf the survivor user's email or mobile is Null (Loyalty user), then the victim (Campaign user) user's email or mobile will merge into a survivor.\nExample 3:\nPrimary identifier - mobile\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nNULL\nM2\nLoyalty User\nE1\nNULL\nIncoming transaction user data\nE1\nM2\nPrimary Identifier (Mobile) Match:\nThe system compares the Mobile identifiers.\nCampaign User has Mobile (M2) and the incoming request has Mobile (M2).\nMerge process\nThe merge occurs because the mobile (M2) of the campaign user matches the corresponding data in the incoming transaction user data(M2), and the email (E1) of the loyalty user matches the corresponding data in the incoming transaction user data(E1).\nAfter Merging\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nNULL\nNULL\nLoyalty User\nE1\nM2\n📘\nNote\nIf the survivor (Loyalty user) user's email or mobile is null, then the victim (Campaign user) user's email or mobile will merge into the survivor.\nThe loyalty user’s email remains the same as E1 and mobile changes to M2 because the victim details will be merged into a survivor.\nCONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is Enabled\nWhen CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, the system skips secondary identifiers during the merging process of campaign and loyalty users. In this scenario, merging will not happen based on secondary identifier matches alone. Instead, merging relies on primary identifier matches between campaign and loyalty users.\nExample 1:\nPrimary Identifier - Mobile\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nE1\nM1\nIncoming transaction user data\nE1\nM2\nMatching Process:\nSince CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, the system ignores the secondary identifier (Email) and only considers the primary identifier (Mobile).The Campaign User has Mobile: M1, which does not match the incoming request's Mobile: M2.\nMerge Process:\nNo existing user with Mobile: M2 is found in the database.\nSince the primary identifier (Mobile) does not match any existing user, no merge happens with the Campaign User.\nA new loyalty user is created with the provided primary identifier (Mobile: M2).\nResult:\nCampaign User: Remains unchanged: Email: E1, Mobile: M1.\nNew Loyalty User: Created with: Email: NULL, Mobile: M2 (since the incoming request's primary identifier is M2, and secondary identifiers are ignored).\nAfter Merging\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nE1\nM1\nNew loyalty user (based on the payload)\nNULL\nM2\nExample 2:\nPrimary Identifier - Mobile\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nE1\nM1\nLoyalty User\nNULL\nM2\nIncoming transaction user data\nE1\nM2\nMatching Process:\nPrimary Identifier (Mobile) Matching:\nThe system looks at the primary identifier (Mobile).\nCustomer 3 has Mobile: M2, which matches with the Loyalty User's Mobile: M2.\nSecondary Identifier (Email) Matching:\nEven though CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, Customer 3's Email: E1 matches the Campaign User's Email: E1.\nHowever, the merge is primarily driven by the primary identifier (Mobile).\nMerge Process:\nSince CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, the merge is based on the primary identifier.\nCustomer 3 (Email: E1, Mobile: M2) matches with both the Campaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and the Loyalty User (Mobile: M2).\nResult:\nThe merge happens because the primary identifier (Mobile) matches. Campaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and Loyalty User (Mobile: M2) are merged.\nAfter Merging\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nNULL\nM1\nLoyalty User\nE1\nM2\n📘\nNote\nIf the survivor user (Loyalty User) has NULL in either email or mobile, the corresponding field from the victim user (Campaign User) will be merged into the survivor.\nIn this case, since the Loyalty User's Email was NULL, it is updated to E1 from the Campaign User.\nExample 3:\nPrimary Identifier - Mobile\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User (Customer 1)\nNULL\nM2\nLoyalty User (Customer 2)\nE1\nNULL\nIncoming transaction user data (Customer 3)\nE1\nM2\nPrimary Identifier Matching:\nThe primary identifier is Mobile.\nCustomer 3 has Mobile: M2, which matches Customer 1's Mobile: M2.\nSecondary Identifier Matching:\nCustomer 3 has Email: E1, which matches Customer 2's Email: E1.\nSince CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is enabled, secondary identifiers should generally be ignored. However, in this case, secondary identifiers still cause a conflict due to the match.\nMerging process:\nThe system identifies that Customer 3's Email (E1) matches Customer 2's Email, and Mobile (M2) matches Customer 1's Mobile. The system gives preference to the Loyalty user (Customer 2).\nThe attempt to add Customer 3 fails because there is a conflict with existing users, and preference is given to the Loyalty user where the primary identifiers are not a match.\nResult:\nCustomer Type\nEmail\nMobile\nCampaign User (Customer 1)\nNULL\nM2\nLoyalty User (Customer 2)\nE1\nNULL\nNew request\nNot added due to conflict\nExample 4:\nPrimary Identifier - Mobile\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nE1\nNULL\nLoyalty User\nNULL\nM2\nIncoming transaction user data\nE1\nM2\nMatching Process:\nPrimary Identifier (Mobile) Matching:\nThe system considers the primary identifier (Mobile).\nCustomer 3 has Mobile: M2, which matches with the Loyalty User's Mobile: M2.\nSecondary Identifier (Email) Matching:\nDespite CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY being enabled, Customer 3's Email: E1 matches the Campaign User's Email: E1.\nHowever, the merge primarily relies on the primary identifier (Mobile).\nMerge Process:\nDue to CONF_SKIP_SECONDARY being enabled, the merge is based on the primary identifier.\nCustomer 3 (Email: E1, Mobile: M2) matches both the Campaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and the Loyalty User (Mobile: M2).\nResult:\nThe merge occurs because the primary identifier (Mobile) matches. The Campaign User (Email: E1, Mobile: M1) and the Loyalty User (Mobile: M2) are merged.\nAfter Merging\nType of User\nEMAIL\nMOBILE\nCampaign User\nNULL\nNULL\nLoyalty User\nE1\nM2\n📘\nNote\nIf the survivor user (Loyalty User) has NULL in either email or mobile, the corresponding field from the victim user (Campaign User) will be merged into the survivor.\nIn this case, since the Loyalty User's Email was NULL, it is updated to E1 from the Campaign User.\nUpdated\nabout 1 month ago\nTable of Contents\nConfigure notifications, auto-approval, OTP settings , and set escalation flow\nUpdate Identifiers Directly (One Step Change)\nDownload Identifier Change Requests\nDelete member account\nMerge Accounts\nSettings for Account Merge Requests\nMerge Accounts Directly (One Step Change)\nDownload Account Merge History\nEffect of account merging on the customer data\nExcluding card merging during account merge\nSkipping secondary identifiers when merging user data\nTerms\nCONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is disabled\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nCONF_SKIP_SECONDARY is Enabled\nExample 1:\nExample 2:\nExample 3:\nExample 4:"

That is, a not-interested transaction can be tagged to the respective customer when the customer registers into the loyalty program within the window period (allowed to convert not-interested transactions).\nConfiguring the window period for retro transaction\nYou can customize the retro transaction window period by adjusting the\nCONF_CLIENT_RETRO_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS\nsetting in\nOrganisation > Billing\nconfiguration page.\nAdditionally, you have the option to incorporate a buffer time using the\nCONF_CLIENT_RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS\nconfiguration. For instance, if you set this value to 3 hours and a customer registers at 9:00 AM, they will be able to claim loyalty points for non-interested transactions with billing times later than 6:00 AM but not before 5:59 AM.\nOne-Step Tagging of a Not-interested Transaction (Retro Transaction)\nIn Member Care, org admins can create new retro requests and approve requests submitted through InStore or APIs.\nTo tag a not-interested transaction to a registered customer on Member Care, follow these steps.\nOn Member Care, navigate to\nTransaction Requests\n>\nTransaction Link\n.\nClick\nOne Step Change\n.\nIn the Search box, enter the mobile number, email ID, or external ID of the customer to which you want to tag a transaction and select the customer from the auto-suggestions drop-down.\nIn Select Transaction, enter the not-interested\nTransaction Number\n, and\nTransaction Date\n. If you have more than one transaction with the same transaction number, use\nStore\nto get transactions of a specific store.\nClick\nSearch\n.\nSelect the transaction if there is more than one transaction (else it is selected by default) and click Tag.\n📘\nYou can tag a transaction only if it is within the window period allowed. To know or update the window period for a retro transaction, see CONF_CLIENT_RETRO_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS on the Billing Configuration page.\nYou will see the error message, Transaction is too old to mark as retro.\nApprove Retro Transaction Requests\nTo approve a retro transaction request submitted through InStore or API, do the following.\n📘\nYou can tag a transaction only if it is within the window period allowed. To know or update the window period for a retro transaction, see CONF_CLIENT_RETRO_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS on the Billing Configuration page.\nYou will see the error message,\nTransaction is too old to mark as retro\n.\nOn the left navigation pane, click\nTransaction Requests\n>\nTransaction Link\n. You will see the list of retro transaction requests with details, requested by, account to be merged with, store at which the request is made, and time of the request.\nIn the\nPending\ntab, navigate to the desired request and click the respective\nApprove\nbutton.\n📘\nTo decline a request, click\nDecline\n. In the\nDecline Coupon Request\nbox, provide the reason for declining this request and click Proceed.\nThe approved and declined requests will move to the Approved and Declined tabs respectively.\nDownload Retro Transaction Requests\nTo download retro transaction request history as a CSV file, do the following:\nOn the\nTransaction Link\npage, click the\nDownload\ndrop-down that appears on the top-right\nSet the duration of the requests that you want to download in\nStart Date\nand\nEnd Date\n.\nIn\nDownload\n, select the statuses that you want to download - Pending, Approved, and Declined\nClick\nProceed\n.\nThe list gets downloaded to your computer as a CSV file.\nNotification Settings for Retro Transactions\nThrough this setting, selected org admins can receive notifications whenever a new retro request is created and also configure SMS and email notification template for the customer when a transaction is tagged to him/her.\nClick\nSettings\n, expand\nID Change Request Settings\n, and click\nRetro Transaction\n.\nIn\nAlerting the supervisor\n, configure the following.\ni. In\nEmail these on arrival of request\n, select the org users to be notified through email whenever a new retro request is created and select any of the following.\nNever\n: Select to disable notifications to the org admins.\nAlways\n: Select to always notify the selected recipients on new retro requests.\nOnly when\n: Select to notify the selected recipients only when the transaction amount is less than a specific value and set the value in\nTransaction value\n<.\nii. In Communicating change to a customer, set SMS/email template.\nTo configure SMS notification, click the\nConfigure\nbutton next to Configure SMS and create the message. Use predefined tags wherever required.\nTo configure email, click the\nConfigure button\nnext to Configure Email.\na. In\nSubject\n, enter the subject of the email.\nb. In the message body, set up the message body with content and insert images. You can add predefined tags in the message wherever required. To add tags, just click the tag from the list on the left.\nc. Click\nSave Changes\n.\nClick\nSave\n.\nHandling retro transactions as per original transaction date.\nRetroactive transactions, also known as retro transactions, refer to transactions that are applied to a loyalty program account after the transaction has taken place. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as an error in the transaction process, a delay in the transaction being recorded, or a promotion being applied retroactively to a past purchase.\nRetro case in airlines\nRetroactive flight rewards refer to the ability to redeem miles or points for flights that you have already taken. Many airline loyalty programs allow you to retroactively claim rewards for flights that you have taken in the past, as long as you were a member of the loyalty program at the time of travel and you have the necessary documentation (e.g., a copy of your boarding pass or ticket receipt).\nTo claim retroactive rewards, you will typically need to contact the airline's customer service department and provide them with your loyalty program account information and the details of your past flights. The process for claiming retroactive rewards can vary by airline.\nIt's worth noting that retroactive flight rewards may not be available for all flights or may be subject to certain restrictions, such as blackout dates or limited availability. It's always a good idea to check with the airline to see what your options are for claiming retroactive rewards.\nLet's understand with one example:\nTake for example, a customer made a flight journey on 20th March but not given loyalty details on that date. Instead, at some point in the future (say 20th april), wishes to avail the benefits of that journey, and so reaches out to customer service for the same. In this case, the processing date (20th April) is more than the transaction date (20th March).\nThis might lead to a problem, because the customer might have upgraded/degraded from a tier in this time period. Say, the customer might be on the silver tier on 20th March and Gold tier on 20th April. If the journey is processed as per 20th April, benefits will be given as per the gold slab even though the customer is on the silver slab on the date of the transaction.\nLet's understand with one more example:\nA brand has the below strategy for tier upgrade. Take 5 international flights in a year and upgrade from silver to gold. Else the customer will be downgraded.\nTier upgrade to silver - Jan 1, 23\nTier downgrade/renewal date - Jan 1, 24\nNow, let's take the above same scenario, however this time the claim happens in next year.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nConfiguring the window period for retro transaction\nOne-Step Tagging of a Not-interested Transaction (Retro Transaction)\nApprove Retro Transaction Requests\nDownload Retro Transaction Requests\nNotification Settings for Retro Transactions\nHandling retro transactions as per original transaction date."

In such scenarios where a new customer has a mobile number of the already registered customer (but inactive), you can reallocate the number to the new customer.\nFor example, consider this case where Tom registers in your loyalty program with the mobile number: 123456789 and is not active for a very long time. Hence, the number is deactivated by the telecom company. Suppose the same number is allocated to another person named John who wants to register in the loyalty program. As Tom is no longer active on the registered mobile number, you can reallocate the number to John and register him.\nTo reallocate the mobile number, do the following.\nOn the navigation pane, click ID Change Requests > Mobile Reallocation.\nThe Mobile Number Re-Allocation Requests page displays the requests for reallocating the old mobile numbers to new customers.\nIn the Pending tab, click the Approve button of the desired request.\nTo decline a request, click Decline. In the Decline Coupon Request box, provide the reason for declining the request and click Proceed.\nYou can see approved and declined requests in their respective tabs (Approved, Declined).\nTo download mobile reallocation requests, click the Download drop-down, set the duration of the requests you want to download in Start Date and End Date, and click Proceed.\nSettings to Auto-approve Mobile Reallocation Requests\nYou can configure to automatically approve mobile reallocation requests without back-end team's approval.\nClick Settings, expand ID Change Request Settings, and click Mobile Re-Allocation.\nSet Auto Approve to On.\nClick Save.\nDownload Mobile Reallocation Requests\nTo download the history of mobile reallocation requests, do the following.\nOn the Mobile Reallocation page, click the Download drop-down that appears on the top-right\nSet the duration of the requests that you want to download in Start Date and End Date\nIn Download, select the statuses that you want to download - Pending, Approved and Declined.\nClick Proceed\nThe list gets downloaded to your computer as a CSV file.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nReallocate Mobile Number (to a New Customer)\nSettings to Auto-approve Mobile Reallocation Requests\nDownload Mobile Reallocation Requests"

This can occur due to a number of factors such as an error in the transaction process, a delay in the transaction being recorded, or a promotion being applied retroactively to a past purchase. Retro transaction allows brands to choose the date to be followed for retro transactions as per their policies.\n📘\nTo enable retro transactions for your org, contact the Capillary sustenance team.\nHandling retro transactions\nCapillary handles retro transactions based on the date of the transaction as well as the date of processing. A not-interested transaction can be tagged to the respective customer when the customer registers into the loyalty program within the window period.\nFor instance, if a customer took a flight on March 20th but did not provide loyalty details on that date and later reached out to the airline’s customer care to obtain loyalty points, the transaction date is March 20th, and the date on which the loyalty points are processed becomes the date of processing.\nTo avail of the airline rewards, the customer can provide flight and loyalty program account information to the airline. The airline then tags the transaction and awards the reward to the customer based on the date of transaction or date of processing.\nConfiguring the window period for retro transaction\nTo customize the retro transaction window, perform the following:\nNavigate to\nOrganisation settings\n.\nNavigate to\nSystems & Deployment\n>\nIntouch POS Configuration\n>\nBilling\n.\nOn the\nBilling configuration\npage, enter the  value in the\nCONF_CLIENT_RETRO_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS\ntextbox to configure the maximum allowed window for a retro transaction.\nTo configure buffer time, in the\nCONF_CLIENT_RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS\nset the value of your choice.\nFor instance, if the value is set to 3, the customer registering at 9:00 AM will be able to claim loyalty points for a non-interested transaction with billing times later than 6:00 AM but not before 5:59 AM.\nSubmiting transaction tagging request\nTransaction tagging request allows you to tag a not-interested transaction into a regular transaction.\nPerform the steps below to submit a transaction tagging request:\nOn the Member Care homepage, search for the user you want to submit a transaction tagging request.\nClick the three-dot menu.\nExpand the\nMore actions\ndropdown, and click\nTransaction requests\n.\nEnter the non-tagged transaction number and click\nSearch transaction\n.\nYou can filter the transactions based on date and store.\nClick\nSave\n.\nTransaction linking request is raised successfully.\nViewing transaction tagging request\nTo view the transaction tagging request, perform the following steps:\nOn the Member Care home page sidebar, navigate to\nMember Care\n>\nRequests\n>\nMember requests\n.\nClick\nTransaction claims\n.\nClick the\nAll\ntab to view all requests. You can click the\nPending\ntab to review a request, the\nApproved\ntab to view approved requests, and the\nRejected\ntab to view requests that were rejected.\nYou can select the desired date range and view the transaction tag request that was created within that specific duration.\nYou can view retro transaction information within the transaction details on Member Care. For more information, refer to the Event details\ndocumentation\n.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nHandling retro transactions\nConfiguring the window period for retro transaction\nSubmiting transaction tagging request\nViewing transaction tagging request"

A standard bill/invoice would not contain a detailed breakup of the points issued to the customer on that bill. It would simply display the total points issued on that bill.\nTo know the detailed view, end users tend to call the customer support, and the kind of Advanced view of the points detail we showed on membercare was very confusing, with all the technical jargon used.\nLet's think of this with a simple use case:\nAs a customer support executive or loyalty manager, I would like to have a simple bill-like view of a Transaction on membercare, to better understand the events taking place in a bill and give a clear summary of the bill to my customers.\nNow, with this latest enhancement:\nNOTE\n: To enable the Advanced points breakup view, raise a ticket to the Capillary's tech team and the UI team.\nWith new improvised points break up view you can see and understand the allocation at line-item & bill level.\nNew view focuses on line item level and bill level break up to help users better understand the allocations done.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago"

You can also access Connect+ directly using the URL of the respective cluster.\nLinks:\nIndia cluster\nEurope cluster\nSingapore cluster\nUS cluster\nDataflow limits\nDefault limit: 300 MB or 2 million records in a single file, whichever is lower.\nMaximum tested limit: 650 MB or 5 million records in a single file. The limit can be increased based on approval. For approval, contact the Capilarry support team.\nIf there are multiple files to be merged, the above limit applies to one file and not the total limit on all files to be merged together.\nUsecases\nData ingestion\nYou can use the Connect+ templates and create a dataflow that can:\nread transaction data from the input CSV file which is stored in the FTP server,\ntransform the input file to API JSON format and\nadd or update the data using the defined APIs as per the schedule.\nExample: Customer add template, Transaction add template, Intouch user add template, data reconciliation template, test and control template etc.\nData export or outflow\nYou can use Connect+ to export the data present in the org in the format required.\nFor example, you can use the appropriate templates and  create a dataflow that can:\njoin multiple files and export to a merged file\ntransfer files from one FTP location to another\nConnect+ does not replace Data Export but extends it by addressing the last-mile operations that cannot be achieved through Data Export.\nBulk requests\nConnect+ can be used to raise requests in bulk and update the data further based on the approval flow. For example, it can be used to create PII deletion requests in bulk.\nData merging\nYou can use Connect+  to merge files and add them to the respective organisation. A wide range of Join templates are available to choose from.\nData conversion\nConnect+ supports data conversion from one format to the other. For example, you can use a CSV to XML file conversion template to convert the data in CSV file format to XML.\nConnect+ Data Import versus Data Import feature\nConnect+\nData import\nConnect+ is used for regularly scheduled or interval-based data ingestion.\nData import is used for historical data ingestion and cleanup operations.\nConnect+ uses Capillary v2 APIs to load data into the Capillary database thus triggering loyalty rules and Dynamic Vouchering System (DVS).\nData import does not trigger loyalty programs or the Dynamic Vouchering System (DVS) as CDP database is directly updated.\nConnect+ supports functionalities such as header mapping, reordering, and other data transformation operations.\nData import does not allow for data manipulation or transformation during the transfer process.\nConnect+ supports data reconciliation by comparing the source file with the output file to identify missing events.\nData import feature does not support data reconciliation.\nTerminologies in Connect+ - Understanding key concepts\nWorkspace\nA Workspace is an org-level or multi-org-level environment for managing data and enables mapping of one or more InTouch organizations to it. It helps ingest the data from different sources into the org-level tables in the Capillary database. The Workspace is created by Connect+ administrators.\nTo select your workspace, click the dropdown next to Connect+, and select your org from the list.\nDataflow\nA dataflow in Connect+ is a defined sequence of steps or operations that you set up to collect data from a defined source, transform, or process data and transfer it to a defined location. It's essentially a workflow specifically designed for handling data. Dataflows in Connect+ can be used to automate tasks such as data ingestion, transformation, and integration between various systems and data sources.\n📘\nEach workspace can have one or more Dataflows.\nExample:\nAn\nAdd transaction\ndataflow that can connect to a source, process data and add to the Capillary platform.\nTemplates\nTemplates in Connect+ are pre-defined configurations or patterns that you can use as a starting point for creating dataflows or integration workflows within the Connect+ platform. These templates are designed to simplify the process of setting up common data integration tasks and processes. You can select a template that matches your use case and create a dataflow.\nFor example, if you frequently need to import data from a specific type of source system into your organization's database, Connect+ might offer a template for that type of integration, making it easier for you to configure the dataflow without having to build it entirely from scratch.\nBlocks in Connect+ templates\nThe blocks in Connect+ templates are the building blocks of dataflow, helping connect to a source such as FTP and a destination such as an API, transform or filter data, merge files, and so on.\nThese blocks are predefined steps or operations that are part of the template's workflow. They represent specific tasks or functions that need to be performed as part of the data integration or workflow process. The building blocks make up the template's logic and determine what the template does and how it behaves.\nHere are some common examples of blocks that you might find in Connect+ templates:\nConnect to Source Block:\nUsed to specify the source of the data that needs to be ingested or transferred, such as connecting to a database, an FTP server, or a cloud storage service.\nDecrypt Block:\nUtilized for decrypting source files, particularly if they are encrypted.\nData Transformation Block:\nDefines how the data should be transformed or manipulated before it's moved to the destination. This can include tasks like data mapping or converting data formats.\nData Destination Block:\nSpecifies where the data should be sent or stored, such as a database, a cloud-based data warehouse, or an analytics platform.\nEncrypt Block:\nUsed for encrypting the output files.\nTrigger Frequency Block:\nContains actions that trigger the dataflow at defined intervals.\n📘\nThe availability and specific actions within a Connect+ template depend on the template's purpose and use case.\nExpressions\nExpressions in Connect+ are conditional expressions that can be used to make filter data or take decisions based on conditions or boolean expressions.\nExample:\n${header_value:equals('paid'):or(${header_value:equals('refunded')})}\nwhere,\n${header_value:equals('paid')}\nchecks if the value of a header named header_value is equal to the string 'paid'. If this condition is met, it returns true.\n:or\nis a logical OR operator used to combine conditions. In this case, it checks whether the previous condition is true OR the following condition is true.\n${header_value:equals('refunded')}\nchecks if the value of the header_value header is equal to the string 'refunded'. If this condition is met, it returns true.\nSo, the entire expression checks if the header_value header is equal to either 'paid' OR 'refunded'. You can use this to filter or process data accordingly.\nFor more information on expressions in Connect+, refer to\nKnow about expressions in Connect+\n.\nUpdated\n28 days ago\nTable of Contents\nBenefits of using Connect+\nAccessing Connect+\nDataflow limits\nUsecases\nData ingestion\nData export or outflow\nBulk requests\nData merging\nData conversion\nConnect+ Data Import versus Data Import feature\nTerminologies in Connect+ - Understanding key concepts\nWorkspace\nDataflow\nTemplates\nExpressions"

'hdr{Mobile_No}'.substring(1) : 'hdr{Mobile_No}'}\nConditional Operations\nOperator\nExpression Format\nExample\n? :\nexp{(conditional expression) ? expression1 : expression2}\nExample 1: Add country code +91 to the mobile number if the length of the number is 10, otherwise return the existing value.\nHeaders: Mobile_No\nExpression:  exp{('hdr{Mobile_No}'.length() == 10) ? '+91'.concat('hdr{Mobile_No}') : 'hdr{Mobile_No}' }\nExample 2: Check if an item is returned. If yes, set transaction type value as 'RETURN' else  set it to 'REGULAR'.\nHeaders: Is_Returned (Possible values 'true' / 'false')\nExpression: exp{ ('yes'.equalsIgnoreCase('hdr{Is_Returned}')) ? 'RETURN' : 'REGULAR' }\nComplex expressions\nExample\nScenario: Calculating non-fractional qualified quantity based on product category\nDescription: In this scenario, we want to compute the qualified quantity based on the product category. If the product category is one of FUEL, JEWEL, or METAL, then the qualified quantity is determined by taking the difference between LineItem_Amount and LineItem_Discount and dividing it by LineItem_Rate. However, if the product category falls outside of these categories, the qualified quantity defaults to LineItem_Qty.\nHeaders: Product_Category, LineItem_Discount, LineItem_Amount, LineItem_Rate, LineItem_Qty\nExpression:\nexp{ ({'FUEL','JEWEL','METAL'}.contains('hdr{Product_Category}') ) ? T(Math).floor( (hdr{LineItem_Amount} - hdr{LineItem_Discount}) / hdr{LineItem_Rate}) : T(Math).floor(hdr{LineItem_Qty}) }\nThis expression employs conditional logic to ensure accurate calculation of the qualified quantity based on the specified conditions and input data.\nUsing SpEL expressions in data transformation\nIn the data transformation block, you can use expressions for the following:\nFiltering data\nMapping attribution identifier type\nMapping header that has consistent values\nFiltering data\nYou can use filter expression to filter the data that needs to be processed.\nConsider a transaction dataflow that includes a\nFinancial status\nheader with values such as paid, refunded, or not paid.\nTo exclusively process dataflow for transactions that are either paid or not paid, in the Transformation block, you can use the filter expression\n${header_value:equals('paid'):or(${header_value:equals('not paid')})}\n. This expression should be entered in the\nFilter tab\nwithin the\ntransformation\ntext box.\nMapping attribution identifier type\nEvery transaction or customer addition is linked to a specific store or till. The details of these stores or tills are configured in the attribution block. Here, you have the flexibility to use expressions to define constant values for the identifier type.\nFor example, consider the scenario of a customer addition dataflow and the store code information is found under the 'SC_NUMBER' column in the source file. Here, you would set the identifierType as 'STORE_CODE' and map the identifierValue to the 'SC_NUMBER' column.\nIn this case, use the expression const{STORE_CODE} in the identifierType field and specify 'SC_NUMBER' as the identifierValue. This setup ensures that the attribution of 'STORE CODE' is consistently associated with the 'SC_NUMBER' column in your data.\nMapping header that has consistent values\nConsider a scenario where you're adding transaction data using the \"add transaction dataflow,\" and all the transactions share the same currency code, INR. The challenge here is that there's no specific header column in the source file indicating the currency code; instead, this information was conveyed via email.\nIn this situation, you can map the header to the API field by performing the following:\nAdd a new column to your source file with the header \"Currency Code\".\nPopulate this new column with the value \"INR\" for all transactions.\nMap this \"Transaction Type\" header to the API field\ncurrencyCode\n.\nThis way, you explicitly specify that the currency code for all transactions is INR. However, there's a more efficient way to achieve this using an expression.\nSimplify with expressions\nYou can streamline this process by using the expression const{INR} in the API field\ncurrencyCode\n. This expression communicates that the value for the API field\ncurrencyCode\nis consistently \"INR\" for all transaction data. This approach eliminates the need for additional columns and simplifies the mapping process.\nAvoiding common errors in expression\nThe examples below can help you to avoid errors when working with the MVEL expressions.\nChallenge\nIssue\nSolution\nExample\nSyntax errors\nIncorrect syntax can lead to parsing errors.\nEnsure correct syntax with proper placement of brackets, quotes, and operators.\nexp{'hdr{to_change}'.equals('1')}\nVariable scope\nReferencing variables outside their scope can be risky.\nDeclare and access variables within the appropriate scope.\nexp{var1 = 'Hello'}\nfollowed by\nexp{var2 = hdr{to_change}.equals(var1)}\nNull handling\nMishandling null values can lead to errors.\nUse null-safe operators to handle potential null values.\nexp{hdr{to_change} != null && hdr{to_change}.equals('1')}\nProperty access\nIncorrect property access syntax can cause issues.\nAccess properties with the correct syntax, such as\nhdr['to_change']\n.\nN/A\nFunction calls\nImproper usage of function calls can lead to errors.\nFollow the correct function call syntax with parentheses and parameters.\nexp{toUpperCase('hello')}\nString concatenation\nIncorrect string concatenation syntax can be problematic.\nUse the '+' operator for string concatenation.\nexp{'Hello ' + 'world'}\nOperator precedence\nIncorrect operator order can yield unexpected results.\nUse parentheses to control the order of evaluation.\nexp{(1 + 2) * 3}\nType conversion\nMismatched data types can cause issues.\nEnsure data types match or perform conversions when needed.\nexp{Integer.parseInt(hdr{to_change}) == 1}\nCollection handling\nMishandling collections can result in errors.\nUnderstand collection operations, including indexing.\nexp{myList[0]}\nComplex expressions\nOvercomplicated expressions can hinder readability.\nKeep expressions concise and organized.\n`exp{(a && b\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nCreating expression\nArithmetic expressions\nString operations\nConditional Operations\nComplex expressions\nUsing SpEL expressions in data transformation\nFiltering data\nMapping attribution identifier type\nMapping header that has consistent values\nAvoiding common errors in expression"

The connect to source block has the following fields:\nField name\nDescription\nHostname\nURL (address) of the SFTP/FTP server from where the source file is available. For example,\ndata.capillarydata.com\n.\nUsername and Password\nCredentials to access this SFTP/FTP server. This provides read/write access to the files on the server.\nSource Directory\nThe directory path where the source file is available. For example,\n/APAC2Cluster/A_Connect\nConnect+ usually supports any text-based files with a delimiter, irrespective of extensions such as .txt, .csv, or .dat etc. In addition, _.ok _file format is also supported.\nFilename Pattern\nFile names in the regex pattern. If you give a filename pattern\nfile\n.*.csv _, the application takes any file that starts with the file name\nfile\n.\nProcessed Directory\nThe path to save the file to be processed. The data to process is captured from the processed file. Processing is the operation of formatting and transforming a given set of data to extract the required information in the appropriate format. For example,\n/APAC2Cluster/Process\n.\nUnzip Files\nIf the files are compressed, you can select this option to unzip the file and then select the original file.\nAPI Error Filepath\nThe SFTP/FTP path where you want to save the API error file. This file includes the error details that occurred during the  API calls. This field is applicable only where API endpoints are required (data ingestion).\nSearch Directory Recursively\nSelect the checkbox, if you want to search for the defined file anywhere in the root folder of the server. For example, if there are multiple folders inside\n/APAC2-Cluster/A_Connect\n, it looks for files matching the pattern inside each folder under\n/APAC2-Cluster/A_Connect\n.\nPort\nThe source SFTP/FTP port number. Generally, 22 for SFTP and 21 for FTP.\nCopy directory file path\nDefining column header for transform block\nAdding the source file header information using a CSV file with the column headers\nYou can upload a CSV file with the column headers of the input source file or define the header data manually. This makes mapping fields in the\ntransformation block\neasier. Once you define the headings, they are automatically retrieved in the transformation blocks and you can map corresponding API fields against them.\nThe maximum supported size of a CSV file is 5 MB. After attaching the file, you can delete it by clicking the delete icon. The system allows you to switch to the manual option after uploading the CSV file. The values should be separated by a comma only. Watch the video below for more information on uploading the CSV file and mapping the API fields.\nAdding the header information manually\nIf you do not have a CSV file for mapping, you can select the\nAdd manually\noption and define the headings manually in the transformation block. Watch the video below for more information.\nIf you do not have a CSV file for mapping and the source file is headerless you can select the\nAdd manually\noption and choose the\nIs file headerless\noption to define the headings separated by a comma. These headings are retrieved in the Transformation block, and you can also add additional headings in the\ntransformation block\nitself. Watch the video below for more information.\nS3 File Service Location as a Source\nField Name\nDescription\nBucket Name\nThe name of your S3 bucket. Provided by the access team.\nRegion\nRegion in which your bucket is located. Provided by the access team.\nAccess Key and Secret\nThese credentials are required to access the S3 bucket. Provided by the access team.\nInput Path\nThe location within the S3 bucket is where the input data resides.\nOutput Path (Processed Path)\nDefines where the processed data will be placed in the S3 bucket. The output path cannot be the same as the input path or a sub-path of the input path (e.g., you cannot have \"input/\" and \"input/processed/\"). Additionally, the output path cannot be the root (\"/\"); a folder must be created within the root for this purpose.\nError Path\nDesignates the location for storing error files.\nUpdated\n29 days ago\nTable of Contents\nDefining column header for transform block\nAdding the source file header information using a CSV file with the column headers\nAdding the header information manually\nS3 File Service Location as a Source"

The API details are auto-filled. You must enter the API client key and secret key to initiate the API.\nThe table contains the fields and their descriptions.\nField name\nDescription\nClient Key\nEnter the API client key. For information on creating an API client key, refer to\nCreating API client key and secret\n.\nClient Secret\nEnter the API client secret. For information on creating an API client key, refer to\nCreating API client key and secret\n.\nAPI EndPoint\nAPI endpoint. For example,\n/v2/customers\n. This field is auto-filled for the available templates.\nAPI Base Url\nAPI cluster URL of the org. For more information on cluster URLs, refer to\ndocumentation on host URLs\n. This field is auto-filled.\nOAuth Base Url\nThis URL is used when an API uses the OAuth for authentication and authorization, serving as the base address for the authorization server. For example: {host}/v3/oauth/token/generate. This field is auto-filled for the pre-defined templates.\nAPI Method\nAPI method. For example, POST. This field is auto-filled for the pre-defined templates.\nBulk Support\nIf set to true, allows for processing multiple records within a single JSON payload. Setting a\ngrouping limit greater than one\nindicates that the system can create bulk payloads for downstream API calls. This field is auto-filled for the pre-defined templates.\nRequest Split Path\nThis is for internal purposes and can be left empty.\nResponse Split Path\nApplicable when Bulk spport is set to true. It is used to divide a single API response containing multiple objects into distinct parts. This is particularly useful for APIs that return a collection of results, such as successes and failures, within a single response. For example, using the expression\n$.result.errors.data._,$.result.success.data._\ngroups the success data under one object and error data under another. Example response below:\n{\n\"result\": {\n\"success\": {\n\"data\": [\n{\n\"id\": \"123\",\n\"status\": true,\n\"message\": \"Customer created successfully\"\n},\n{\n\"id\": \"456\",\n\"status\": true,\n\"message\": \"Order placed successfully\"\n}\n]\n},\n\"errors\": {\n\"data\": [\n{\n\"id\": \"789\",\n\"status\": false,\n\"code\": \"E101\",\n\"message\": \"Invalid address\"\n}\n]\n}\n}\n}\nRecoverable Error Codes\nSpecific error codes that indicate situations in which the system should attempt to retry the failed operation. For example, you can error codes such as - 502 Bad Gateway, 504 Gateway Timeout, 520 Unknown Error, 521 Web Server Is Down etc.\nParse Path Map\nLets you define expressions to parse the status message and error code from your API response, and include them in the error file. This is crucial since API responses can have varying structures for error information. This field is auto-filled for the pre-defined templates. Ex:\n{\"status_code\": \"$.error.code\", \"error_message\": \"$.error.message\",\"displayLabel\": \"$.error.displayLabel\"}\nYielding Error Codes\nError codes that will be retried an unlimited number of times. This strategy is usually reserved for specific error types where the expectation is that the issue will eventually resolve without intervention, but it might take an indefinite amount of time.\nExample: When a \"429\" error (indicating that the request rate is too high) is encountered, the system configured with this strategy will retry the request indefinitely until it is successful. This is because the rate limit is expected to eventually lift, allowing the request to proceed.\nMax Retries\nDefines the maximum number of attempts to make an API request in case of failures. This field is auto-filled for the pre-defined templates.\nAdditional headers\nApplicable only for certain templates. This enables the auto-approval for the request. For example, for issuing goodwill points or for tagging customers to an old transaction templates, this enables auto-approval for those requests.\nError Handling\nIn case of any errors connecting to the destination URL, refer\nTroubleshooting guide\n.\nUpdated\n16 days ago"

To achieve this,  you need to map the fields in the source files to the appropriate API fields in this block.  This helps connect+ to convert the data to JSON, call the APIs successfully and upload the data. These fields in this Connect+ block are parameters of the JSON payload of the API associated with the template that you have selected for the dataflow.\nPerform the following to map the fields:\nIf the workspace is linked to multiple orgs, select the org ID from the\nIntouch Org\ndrop-down.\nIn the\nFile Delimiter\ntext box, enter the delimiter used to separate the headings in the source file. By default, the delimiter is set as a comma.\nMap the API fields with the appropriate columns in the source file. To map, perform the following:\nIf the column header fields were not uploaded or defined, enter the column header name in the\nFile header\ntext box. This is the name of the column header in the source file that will have information for an API field. For example, a column named source can have values for the API field called source. You can also click on\nAdd more headers\nand can\nadd more headers\nor\nadd headers using expression\n.\nSelect the\nAPI field\nname from the API fields drop-down that corresponds to the column header specified in the File header text box. The number of mandatory fields that need to be mapped is displayed next to the parent API field.\nIf required, in the\nFilter data\ntext box, use\nexpression language\nand add a filter condition to include or exclude data from the source file.\nExample:\nConsider a transaction dataflow that includes a\nFinancial status\nheader with values such as paid, refunded, or not paid. To exclusively process dataflow for transactions that are either paid or not paid, you can use the filter expression\n${header_value:equals('paid'):or(${header_value:equals('not paid')})}\n.\nRefer\nDefining column headers\nfor more information on mapping the API fields.\nAdding a header using the expression\nIf the value of an\nAPI Field\nis the same for all the customers, you can use\nconst{value}\n. For example, to categorize\nloyaltyType\nas\nloyalty\nfor all customers, you can enter\nconst{loyalty}\nagainst the API field\nloyaltyType\n.  For more information, refer to the documentation on\nusing expression\n.\nTo add a header using an expression,\nClick\nAdd header using expression\n.\nEnter the expression in the text box.\nFrom the API field drop-down, select the API field you want to map to the header.\nAdding additional header\nIf you selected\nAdd manually\nas the Column headers input method (with or without header names) for transforming data in the\nConnect to source\nblock, you will have the option to add additional headers. You can add the additional header while mapping the fields or\nediting\n.\n🚧\nNote\nIf you added the header information through the CSV file method, you cannot add additional headers.\nUpdated\n29 days ago\nTable of Contents\nAdding a header using the expression\nAdding additional header"

You need to enter the details of files that need to be identified, compared and merged. Enter the below details:\nField\nDescription\nFiles 1-2 Join Types\nEnables you to select the type of SQL join command.\n1.\nInner join\n-  An Inner Join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined.\nFor example, suppose you have two tables: \"Line item table\" and \"Bill level table,\" and you want to determine which items were purchased in each bill and calculate the total cost of each item in every bill. When you use the Inner Join option, the merged table will include only the records that have matching BillNumbers in both data sources.\n2.\nLeft outer join\n- A Left Outer Join returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.\nFor example, consider two tables: \"Customers\" and \"Orders.\" When you use a Left Outer Join, you retrieve all customer records along with any matching order records. If a customer has no orders, the customer record is still included with NULL values in the order-related columns.\n3.\nRight outer join\n- A Right Outer Join returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.\nFor example, consider two tables: \"Orders\" and \"Customers.\" When you perform a Right Outer Join, you retrieve all order records along with any matching customer records. If an order has no associated customer, the order record is still included with NULL values in the customer-related columns.4.\nOuter join\n- An Outer Join, also known as a Full Outer Join, returns all rows from both tables, including matching rows and those with no matches.\nAll Files Delimiter\nEnter the file delimiter (comma or tab) to separate fields in the .csv file. By default, the delimiter is a comma (,).\nFile 1 Regex\nEnter the name of your first file here in the format\nfilename_.*.fileformat\n. The asterisk represents the wildcard.\nFor example, for the system to search for files that begin with the name \"BILL_LEVEL_MERGE\" followed by any sequence of characters you can enter the file name as \"BILL_LEVEL_MERGE.*.csv\". This will enable the system to locate files that match this pattern.\nNOTE:\nThe file works in an FCFS manner. The files that are uploaded first and second are merged first.\nFile 2 Regex\nEnter the name of your second file in the format:\nfilename.*.fileformat\n. The asterisk represents the wildcard.\nFor example, for the system to search for files that begin with the name \"BILL_LEVEL_MERGE\" followed by any sequence of characters you can enter the file name as \"BILL_LEVEL_MERGE.*.csv\". This will enable the system to locate files that match this pattern.\nNOTE\n: The file works in an FCFS manner. The files that are uploaded first and second are merged first.\nFile 1 Headers\nEnter the column header name of File 1 that needs to be compared.\nThis is compared with the column headers in the File 2.\nTo match columns based on multiple headers, enter the header names separated by a comma.\nFile 2 Headers\nEnter the column header name of File 2 that needs to be compared.\nThis is compared with the column headers in the File 1.\nTo match columns based on multiple headers, enter the header names separated by a comma.\nFile Join Use Case\nFrom the dropdown, select TRANSACTION_LINE_ITEM.\nThis is an inner join operation where one row in the bill maps to multiple line items.\n**NOTE:**The option None is not applicable.\nOutput Filename\nEnter the output filename.\nBy default, the filename format is merge_yyy-mm-dd, where merge is the file name, yyyy-mm-dd is the year month, and date on which the file is created.\nAlphabetical Sort\nSelect this check box to ensure accurate sorting of the files in alphanumerical order. By default, this is always enabled.\nNOTE: It is recommended to always select the checkbox before proceeding further.\nMerge based on common Name\nMake sure that this check box is always selected.\nThis makes sure that the system identifies the correct files to be merged.\nMerge based on common name Template File One\nEnter the filename using the\ntag.\nFor example, if there are files with names\nTktABC.dat\n, and\nTktDocument_ABC.dat\n, and if you enter the value as TktDocument\n.dat, the system looks for the file and selects TktDocument_ABC.dat for merging.\nABC is the common tag among the files.\nMerge based on common Name Template File Two\nEnter the filename using the\ntag.\nFor example, if there are files with names\nTktABC.dat\nand\nTktDocument_ABC.dat\n, and if you enter the value as TktDocument\n.dat, the system looks for the file and selects TktDocument_ABC.dat for merging.\nABC is the common tag among the files.\nFile One is Headerless\nSelect the check box if the columns in file one do not have a header.\nFile Two is Headerless\nSelect the check box if the columns in file two do not have a header.\nFile One Mention Header names\nDefine the heading order of the columns in fIle one separated by commas.\nFile Two Mention Header names\nDefine the heading order of the columns in fIle two separated by commas.\nMatch All Regex\nSelect\nTrue\nfrom the dropdown to keep only the matching files in the server and delete the files that are not matched. By default, the value is set as\nFalse\n.\nAll Unique Match\nSelect\nTrue\nto identify and delete duplicate files.\nFTP file upload instructions\nWhen uploading files to the FTP path:\nEnsure that all files that need to be merged are added simultaneously.\nIf you are adding different sets of files that need to be merged, maintain a minimum gap of at least 10 minutes between each upload. For example, if you want to merge files A and B, and also C and D, do not add files A, B, C, and D together. Add files A and B first, and then add files C and D only after a minimum of 10 minutes.\nIf you need to re-add any files:\nRemove the existing file from the process folder first.\nThen, add the new files to the input folder for proper handling.\nUpdated\n29 days ago\nTable of Contents\nFTP file upload instructions"

This is often a prerequisite for grouping to group the similar entries.\nAlphabetical sort\nArranges data in alphabetical or alphanumeric order based on a chosen column\nGroup by\nCollects and organizes data entries that share the same value in a specified header. When you group by a field (e.g., \"bill ID\"), all rows with the same value are consolidated into a single JSON object, with the grouping key appearing once and the related fields organized as a sub-structure (like an array). Sorting by the grouping field often precedes this operation to ensure all related entries are grouped together.\nGrouping limit\nThe \"grouping limit\" parameter sets a threshold on the number of grouped entries to be included in a single output structure. This helps manage payload size when handling many related entries. For example, if grouping by \"bill ID\" with a limit of 10, each JSON object will contain information for up to 10 bills; if there are more than 10, multiple output structures will be generated. It effectively splits bulk data into manageable chunks.\nExample\nConsider a CSV file containing records for different bills. Each bill may have multiple identifiers (mobile or email) and associated items. The goal is to:\nSort\nthe data so that rows with the same\nbill ID\nare together.\nApply an\nalphabetical sort\nto ensure a consistent order.\nGroup by\nthe\nbill ID\nto combine records for each bill.\nApply a\ngrouping limit\nso that each output structure contains data for a maximum of two unique bill IDs.\nOriginal CSV Data\nbill ID,identifier name,identifier value,itemID\nBILL002,email,\n[email protected]\n,ITEM-A\nBILL001,mobile,040-1234567,ITEM-X\nBILL002,mobile,050-9876543,ITEM-B\nBILL001,email,\n[email protected]\n,ITEM-Y\nBILL003,mobile,044-5551234,ITEM-P\nBILL001,mobile,044-1112233,ITEM-Z\nBILL003,email,\n[email protected]\n,ITEM-Q\nBILL002,email,\n[email protected]\n,ITEM-C\nStep 1: Sorting and Alphabetical Sort\nPurpose:\nArrange rows based on the\nbill ID\nand alphabetically/alphanumerically so that records with the same bill are adjacent.\nConfiguration:\nSet\nSort header\nvalue to\nbill ID\nand\nAlphabetical Sort\nto True.\nResult:\nThe data is reordered alphabetically (or alphanumerically) by\nbill ID\n.\nSorted CSV Data\nbill ID,identifier name,identifier value,itemID\nBILL001,mobile,040-1234567,ITEM-X\nBILL001,email,\n[email protected]\n,ITEM-Y\nBILL001,mobile,044-1112233,ITEM-Z\nBILL002,email,\n[email protected]\n,ITEM-A\nBILL002,mobile,050-9876543,ITEM-B\nBILL002,email,\n[email protected]\n,ITEM-C\nBILL003,mobile,044-5551234,ITEM-P\nBILL003,email,\n[email protected]\n,ITEM-Q\nStep 2: Group By\nPurpose:\nGroup all records with the same\nbill ID\ninto a single JSON object.\nConfiguration:\nSet \"group by\" as\nbill ID\n.\nJSON Structure (Before Applying Grouping Limit):\nJSON\n[\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL001\",\n    \"identifiers\": [\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"040-1234567\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"044-1112233\" }\n    ],\n    \"items\": [\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-X\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Y\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Z\" }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL002\",\n    \"identifiers\": [\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"050-9876543\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" }\n    ],\n    \"items\": [\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-A\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-B\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-C\" }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL003\",\n    \"identifiers\": [\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"044-5551234\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" }\n    ],\n    \"items\": [\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-P\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Q\" }\n    ]\n  }\n]\nStep 3: Grouping Limit\nPurpose:\nLimit the number of grouped entries in each output structure to make payloads more manageable.\nConfiguration:\nSet a\ngrouping limit of 2\n, meaning that each output structure will contain data for at most two unique\nbill ID\ngroups. If the total number of unique\nbill ID\nvalues exceeds this limit, the output is split into multiple JSON structures.\nResult with Grouping Limit of 2:\nOutput 1\nJSON\n[\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL001\",\n    \"identifiers\": [\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"040-1234567\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"044-1112233\" }\n    ],\n    \"items\": [\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-X\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Y\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Z\" }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL002\",\n    \"identifiers\": [\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"050-9876543\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" }\n    ],\n    \"items\": [\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-A\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-B\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-C\" }\n    ]\n  }\n]\nOutput 2\nJSON\n[\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL003\",\n    \"identifiers\": [\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"044-5551234\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" }\n    ],\n    \"items\": [\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-P\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Q\" }\n    ]\n  }\n]\nNote:\nIn this example, there are three unique\nbill ID\nvalues. With a grouping limit of 2, the first output contains grouped data for\nBILL001\nand\nBILL002\n, while the second output contains grouped data for\nBILL003\n.\nResult with Grouping Limit of 3:\nJSON\n[\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL001\",\n    \"identifiers\": [\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"123-456-7890\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"111-222-3333\" }\n    ],\n    \"items\": [\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-X\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Y\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Z\" }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL002\",\n    \"identifiers\": [\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"987-654-3210\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" }\n    ],\n    \"items\": [\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-A\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-B\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-C\" }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL003\",\n    \"identifiers\": [\n      { \"identifier name\": \"mobile\", \"identifier value\": \"555-123-4567\" },\n      { \"identifier name\": \"email\", \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\" }\n    ],\n    \"items\": [\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-P\" },\n      { \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Q\" }\n    ]\n  }\n]\nResult with No Grouping:\nJSON\n[\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL002\",\n    \"identifier name\": \"email\",\n    \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\",\n    \"itemID\": \"ITEM-A\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL001\",\n    \"identifier name\": \"mobile\",\n    \"identifier value\": \"123-456-7890\",\n    \"itemID\": \"ITEM-X\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL002\",\n    \"identifier name\": \"mobile\",\n    \"identifier value\": \"987-654-3210\",\n    \"itemID\": \"ITEM-B\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL001\",\n    \"identifier name\": \"email\",\n    \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\",\n    \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Y\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL003\",\n    \"identifier name\": \"mobile\",\n    \"identifier value\": \"555-123-4567\",\n    \"itemID\": \"ITEM-P\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL001\",\n    \"identifier name\": \"mobile\",\n    \"identifier value\": \"111-222-3333\",\n    \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL003\",\n    \"identifier name\": \"email\",\n    \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\",\n    \"itemID\": \"ITEM-Q\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"bill ID\": \"BILL002\",\n    \"identifier name\": \"email\",\n    \"identifier value\": \"\n[email protected]\n\",\n    \"itemID\": \"ITEM-C\"\n  }\n]\nUpdated\n29 days ago\nTable of Contents\nExample\nOriginal CSV Data\nStep 1: Sorting and Alphabetical Sort\nStep 2: Group By\nStep 3: Grouping Limit"

This helps to process the events within Connect+ before it reaches Capillary’s event notification.\nAbout Kafka\nKafka is a software framework where data is published and stored. In Kafka, event data are grouped into specified topics called Kafka topics. A Kafka topic is a channel where specific event data is stored and streamed. Each Kafka topic has a unique name.\nFields\nDescription\nKafka Topics comma separated\nA dropdown field where you can select one or more Kafka topics. Each topic has a checkbox—by checking the ones you need, the event will be added. This field specifies the event names (which correspond to Kafka topics in the event notification system) that you want to retrieve events from.\nUpdated\n16 days ago\nTable of Contents\nAbout Kafka"

This helps to reduce the number of API calls that are required to change the status in bulk.\nUse case\nBrands send customer data to Capillary to change their test and control status.\nUsing the Test and Control template, you can compare your existing customer data with the customer test and control data provided by the brand to make changes in the customer role in bulk rather than changing the data for each customer.\nConfiguring test and control dataflow\n🚧\nMake sure that there are no unwanted spaces in the csv file. You can convert the csv file to JSON to cehck for unwanted spaces.\nTo configure test and control dataflow, perform the below steps/actions:\nIn the\nConnect-to-source section\nBlock\nenter the source server details where the source\ndata is present and the location for saving the processed file. See\nConnect to source\n.\nIn the\nDecrypt data\nblock, if the files are encrypted, enter the details to decrypt the data. See\nDecrypt data\n.\nIn the\nTransform Data\nblock, map the API fields with the source file. For information on how to map the fields, see\nTransform data\n.\nIn the\nMap-fields-for-reconcile\nblock, enter the reconciliation data details.\nFields\nDescription\nMobile\nEnter the column header that contains the mobile number of the customers.\nEmail\nEnter the column header that contains the email of the customers.\nTest and Control\nEnter the column header that contains the test and control status.\nExternal ID\nEnter the column header that contains the external ID.\nReconciliation Results Directory\nSpecify the file path to store the data reconciliation result.\nIn the\nConnect-to-destination\nblock, enter the API endpoint details.\nFor this template, the API\n/v2/tnc/change/bulk/customers\nis used. See\nConnect to destination\n.\nIn the\nTrigger\nblock, enter the details to schedule the trigger. See\nTrigger\n.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nUse case\nConfiguring test and control dataflow"

The source data can be a .csv file or any other data format and contains events such as transactions or customer registrations.\nThe purpose of comparing source data with data ingested into the Capillary platform is to identify any missing events that may have failed to be ingested due to various reasons. The process of comparing the source data with the data in Capillary platform is known as data reconciliation and is important for ensuring accurate reporting and downstream events, particularly for loyalty customers.\nUse case\nConsider that on January 1st, 2022, there were 100 transaction events that were expected to be captured in the Capillary platform. However, due to certain issues or errors, only 90 events were successfully recorded in the platform, resulting in 10 missing events. These 10 missing events need to be identified and ingested into the platform.\nWith data reconciliation dataflow, you can compare the source data with the transactions in Insights+ backend and identify the missing data.\nConfiguring data reconciliation dataflow\nTo configure data reconciliation dataflow, perform the below steps/actions:\nIn the\nConnect to source\nBlock\n, enter the source server details where the source data is present and the location for saving the processed file. See\nConnect to source\n.\nIn the\nMap fields for reconciliation\nblock, map the source data fields to the CDP fields to initiate comparison and identify missing data. See\nMap fields for reconciliation\n.\nIn the\nTrigger frequency\nblock, set the trigger frequency. See\nTrigger frequency\n.\nMap fields for reconciliation\nIn this section, you need to map the fields in the source data to the fields in the Capillary platform.\nAt present, the following transaction types of data can be compared with the Capillary platform.\nRegular transaction line items\n- To compare and identify missing regular transactions in the Capillary platform.\n📘\nMap multiple fields to identify the unique transaction\nIf a transaction contains multiple line items with the same bill number but with different codes, and if you map only the bill number,  when the system compares the source data with the data in the platform, it matches only the bill number and considers the transaction as already available in the platform.\nIf you map the bill number and other fields such as store code, year, bill date, rate etc, the system matches properly and identifies the missing transaction accordingly.\nSee the below image for an example of a transaction with the same bill number repeated multiple times but one among those appears against a different store code. In this case, if you map only the bill number, the system matches only the bill number and if a transaction with the respective bill number is available in the platform, after processing, it marks all transactions with that bill number as 1 (data already available in the system/not missing data).\nReturn transaction line items\n- To compare and identify missing return transactions in the Capillary platform. Similar to regular transaction line items, it is recommended to map multiples to identify the unique transaction.\nCustomer\n- To compare and identify missing customer data in the Capillary platform.\nProduct\n- To compare and identify missing product data in the Capillary platform.\nTo map the field names, in the\nTransformation\ntext box, enter the Capillary data field name against the corresponding source data field name (\nAPI field)\n. For example, if the source data field name for the field that contains billing data information is\nBilling data\n, in the\nTransformation\ntext box, enter the Capillary data field name where you have the same information.\nIf you want to map the date fields, from the\nDate format\ndrop-down, select the desired date format.\nIn the\nFrom year\nfield, enter the year from which you want to compare the data.\nBy default, it will compare source data with the platform data from the previous year to the present date.\nIf you enter a year, for example, 2016,  it will compare source data with platform data from 2016 up to the current year. This option is available to speed up the comparison process.\nIn the\nReconciliation Results Directory\nfield, enter the directory where you need to save the processed data. In the processed file. If the URL is /APAC2Cluster/EUConnect, enter only the path APAC2Cluster/EUConnect in the\nReconciliation Results Directory\nfield. You can use this file to ingest the missing data to the Capillary platform.\nIn the output file, the application creates a CAP_API_STATUS column and in the column, the missing data is marked as 0 and the existing data is marked as 1.\nIngestion of the missing data\nTo ingest the missing data, perform the following\nUse the respective data flow template and in the connect to source, enter the\nReconciliation Results Directory\npath in the\nSource Directory\nfield. For example, if you want to add a missing transaction, enter the output file path of the Data reconciliation template in the source directory of the transaction add template.\nIn the filter header field, enter the heading\nCAP_API_STATUS\n. This is the status column header in the processed file of the reconciliation dataflow.\nIn the\nFilter-Data\n, define the\nFilter Condition\nas\n${header_value:equals(0)}\n. This enables the template to ingest the rows that are marked as missing (0).\n📘\nNOTE\nThe insights+ backend data has a lag of one day. ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) runs only once every night (according to org time zone).\nIf you are running reconciliation dataflow on daily basis, make sure that you schedule the trigger with a gap of  12-24 hours after the ETL completion. Triggering the dataflow before the ETL completion can result in  the system condidering the new data as missing data and ingessting it.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nUse case\nConfiguring data reconciliation dataflow\nMap fields for reconciliation\nIngestion of the missing data"

One file contains bill-level information, including total amounts, dates, and customer details. The other file contains line-level data, such as individual items, quantities, and prices. The retail company wants to create a consolidated dataset that combines bill-level and line-level data. They want to know which items were purchased in each bill and calculate the total cost of each item in every bill.\nSolution:\nThey can use Transaction line item merge template and choose the \"Inner Join\" option to include only the records that have matching BillNumbers in both data sources.\nConfiguring transaction line item merge dataflow\nTo configure transaction line item merge dataflow, perform the below steps/actions:\nIn the\nConnect-to-source\nBlock\n, enter the source server details where the source data is present and the location for saving the processed file. See\nConnect to source\n.\nIn the\nDecrypt data\nblock, if the files are encrypted, enter the details to decrypt the data. See\nDecrypt data\n.\nIn the\nJoin-Data\nblock, enter the required details and define the conditions to merge the two files and join the data. See\nJoin Data\n.\nIn the\nTransform Data\nblock, map the API fields with the source file. For information on how to map the fields, see\nTransform data\n.\nIn the\nConnect-to-destination\nblock, Enter the API endpoint details. See\nConnect to destination\n.\nFor this template, the API\n/v2/transactions/bulk\nis used.\nIn the\nTrigger\nblock, enter the details to schedule the trigger. See\nTrigger\n.\nFAQ\nQ:\nIs it mandatory to enable\nMerge based on common Name\ncheckbox?\nA:\nYes, It is mandatory to\nMerge based on common Name\ncheckbox to make sure the correct files are merged together.\nQ:\nHow to view the transaction details in Memebercare against the customer?\nA:\nYou can view the customer details in Membercare by clicking on Transactions under the Events tab.\nQ:\nIs it mandatory to enable the\nAlphabetical sort\ncheckbox?\nA:\nYes, it is highly recommended to enable the\nAlphabetical sort\ncheckbox to ensure accurate sorting of the files in alphanumerical order.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nUse case\nConfiguring transaction line item merge dataflow\nFAQ"

These serve as a form of gamification and a sense of pride and accomplishment within the user, reinforcing the targeted behaviours and boosting engagement. For more information on Badges, refer to the\nBadges user documentation\n.\nThe badges Connect+ template enables you to create and update Badges in bulk.\nTo configure the Badges template, perform the below steps/actions:\nIn the\nConnect-to-source\nBlock\n, enter the source server details where the source\ndata is present and the location for saving the processed file.

It can be used to migrate customers with badges:\nthat have expired or\nwere assigned in the past but are still active.\nUse Case\nConsider Brand X, which has been running a successful loyalty program for several years, where customers earn badges for purchases, engagement, and specific achievements on their existing loyalty platform.\nWhen Brand X decides to switch to the Capillary loyalty platform to take advantage of advanced features and better system integration, it can transfer all historical badges awarded to customers using the Historical Migration and Creation of Badges template. This ensures a smooth transition without losing any customer achievements.\nConfiguring the template\nBelow is the screenshot of the template showing the different steps.\nTo configure the Badges template, perform the below steps/actions:\nIn the\nConnect-to-source\nBlock\n, enter the source server details where the source\ndata is present and the location for saving the processed file.

See\nDecrypt data\n.\nIn the\nTransform Data\nblock, map the API fields with the source file.

The token is not mandatory and you can enter any random string in this field if you do not have token.\nIn the\nTrigger section\nblock, define the duration at which the system should check the FTP location for the new file and update the audience list.

You can also map all users whom you are onboarding to a single user.\nemail\nEmail ID of the user.\nuserRole\nRole of the user. Enter a valid role defined for this org in\nIntouch > Organization setup > Roles & Privileges\n. The API throws an error if the role entered does not belong to the user's org.

The corresponding event names created in the org are fetched by the system and appear in the\nSelect Event\ndrop-down.\nSelect the event you want to configure and ingest from the\nSelect Event\ndrop-down.\nClick\nContinue\n.  As a result, the attribute fields are auto-populated according to the selected event.\nIn the\nAttribution\ntab, map the fields.

For more information, refer to the detailed documentation on the\nTransform data block\n.\n(Optional) To pass a custom event date time, map the\neventDateTime\nAPI field.  You can also add an older event date. If the event date time is not defined, the system considers the actual event processed time.\n(Optional) To define the event date time format for the\neventDateTime\n, enable the\nFormat transaction data\ncheck box and select the date and time format from the\nEvent Date Format\ndrop-down. This should match the entered date format.\nThe supported formats are:\nyyyy-MM-dd-HH:mm:ss\ndd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss\ndd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss\nyyyy-MM-dd\nMM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss\nyyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss\ndd-MM-yyyy\nMM/dd/yyyy\nyyyy-dd-MM HH:mm:ss\nyyyyMMdd\nIn the\nConnect-to-destination\nblock, enter the following details:\nIn the\nAPI Base Url\nfield, enter the webhook URL.

The badges can be also issued for a past (retro) transaction.\nUse Case 1: Weekly Behavioral Events Data Import\nScenario:\nA brand receives weekly data from its third-party vendor who manages their mobile app and websites. This data contains behavioural events from users' interactions with the app and website.\nThe third-party vendor provides the brand with weekly behavioural event data and on adding these data to the Capillary platform, the loyalty promotions on the Capillary platform are triggered. Accordingly, based on the loyalty programs, badges also may need to be provided to the customers in bulk. This template can be used to achieve the same.\nUse Case 2: Offline Event Badge Issuance\nScenario:\nA brand organizes offline events, where customers participate and interact with the brand physically. As part of these events, some badges are issued to the customers. This template can be used to assign the badges to the existing customers.\nConfiguring earned badges for customer dataflow\nTo configure earned badges for customer dataflow, perform the below steps/actions:\nIn the\nConnect-to-source section\nBlock\nenter the source server details where the source\ndata is present and the location for saving the processed file.

Attempting to update rewards with both configurations in a single operation will cause reward update to fail. To avoid this, use separate CSV files and data flows for each configuration. For instance, one CSV file should contain only rewards created with Intouch points, while a separate CSV and data flow should be used to update rewards with the payment configuration.\nConfiguring Update Rewards Template\nPerform the below steps/actions:\nFrom the dataflow templates, select\nUpdate Rewards\n.\nIn the\nConnect-to-source section\nBlock\nenter the source server details where the source\ndata is present and the location for saving the processed file. For the information on configuring this block, refer to\nConnect to source\ndocumentation\nIn the\nDecrypt data\nblock, if the files are encrypted, enter the details to decrypt the data. For the information on configuring this block, refer to\nDecrypt data\ndocumentation.\nIn the\nTransform Data\nblock, map the API fields with the source file. For information on how to map the fields, see\nTransform data\n.

This template can be used to validate a set of records and further process the records that meet the validation requirements. The validation rules are defined in the Databricks notebook.\nUse case\nA brand wants to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data before processing them further. They decide to implement batch feed validations using Databricks.\nThe brand's data engineering team develops validation rules using Databricks. These rules include checks for data completeness, consistency, and accuracy. For example, they may check if each order contains valid customer information, product details, and payment information.\nFurther, the brand can use the Connect+ template to trigger the Databricks notebook at regular intervals.\nConfiguring databricks job trigger template\nTo configure the Databricks job trigger dataflow, perform the below steps/actions:\nIn the\nConnect-to-source section\nBlock\nenter the source server details where the source\ndata is present and the location for saving the processed file. See\nConnect to source\n.\nIn the\nDatabricks-Job-trigger-and-status\nblock, enter the following information:\nJob ID\n: Enter the job ID of the Databricks job that needs to be triggered.\nMax retries\n:  This parameter defines the maximum number of attempts a file undergoes processing before it is marked as failed. By default, the maximum retries value is set to 10. When a Databricks job is triggered, and while it is running, subsequent job triggers must wait until the ongoing job is completed. The system periodically checks the status of the job every minute until either the job completes successfully or reaches the maximum retry count. If the job is still running after one minute, the system enters a retry loop, repeatedly checking the job status until it either completes or reaches the maximum retry count. If the maximum retry count is exceeded without successful completion, the file in the queue is considered unprocessed.\ndataBricks Processed Files Path\n:  This parameter specifies the destination file path where Databricks stores the files after executing the job. Regardless of whether the job succeeds or fails, the resulting files are stored at this location. Databricks uses the credentials entered in the \"Connect to source\" section to add the files to this location.\ndataBricksToken\n:  This parameter specifies the Databricks token used to secure authentication for the Databricks API instead of using passwords.\nIn Databricks, user permissions and roles determine who can create personal access tokens. The workspace administrator sets these permissions and can create custom roles and groups with specific permissions. If you belong to a role or group with the right permissions, you can create access tokens by navigating to User Settings > Developer > Access Tokens in Databricks.\ndataBricksUrl\n- This parameter specifies the Databricks URL. If the URL is null, it retrieves the default value configured under Properties in the Processor Details of Databricks.\nSyntax\n: https://${DATABRICKS_HOST}/api/${DATABRICKS_API_VERSION}/jobs\nExample\n:\nhttps://capillary-scrum.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.1/jobs\n, where:\nDATABRICKS_HOST -\nhttps://capillary-scrum.cloud.databricks.com\nDATABRICKS_API_VERSION - 2.1\nIn the\nTrigger\nblock, enter the details to schedule the trigger. Refer to\nTrigger\nfor more information.\nFor troubleshooting information, refer to\ntroubleshooting section\n.\nUpdated\n7 months ago\nTable of Contents\nUse case\nConfiguring databricks job trigger template"

The file\nabc.csv\ncolumns have headers named\nTransaction_value\nand\nBill_ID\n. However, the brand requests Capillary to send the file abc.csv with column header names\nTAmount\nand\nBill_No\nrespectively.\nWith the SFTP to SFTP with Headers Definition template, you can change the column header name in the file during file transfer from one location to another.\nScenario 2\nConsider you are transferring a file named\nabc.csv\nfrom the Capillary server to a brand's server. The columns in the file\nabc.csv\ndo not have header names. However, the brand requests Capillary to send the file\nabc.csv\nwith column header names.\nWith the SFTP to SFTP with Headers Definition template, you can add header names in the file during file transfer from one location to another.\nConfiguring SFTP to SFTP with Headers Definition\nBelow is the screenshot of the template showing the different steps.\nTo configure SFTP to SFTP with Headers Definition dataflow, the following are the steps:\nIn the\nConnect-to-source\nblock\n, enter the source server details where the source data is present and the location for saving the processed file. See\nConnect to source\n.\nIn the\nConnect-to-destination\nblock, enter the destination SFTP server details. See\nConnect to destination\n.\nIn the\nDefine-headers-and-transform-data\nblock, enter header mapping. See\nRebuild headers / Define headers and transform data\n.\nIf the files are encrypted, enter the details to decrypt the data. For information on configuring this block, refer to\nDecrypt data\n.\nIn the Encrypt-data block, enter the encryption details to encrypt the file. See\nEncrypt data\nIn the\nTrigger-block\n, enter the details to schedule the trigger. See\nTrigger\n.\nConnect to destination\nThis block enables you to define the destination server details. Below is the screenshot showing the fields in the Connect to destination step.\nBelow are the fields in the block.\nField Name\nDescription\nHostname\nURL (address) of the SFTP server from where the source file is available. For example, data.capillarydata.com.\nUsername and Password\nCredentials to access this SFT server. This provides read/write access to the files on the server.\nRemote Path\nDirectory path in the destination server where the file is transferred. For example, /APAC2Cluster/A_Connect\nCreate Remote Directory\nChoose this option to create a directory at the destination if it does not already exist.\nZip Files\nChoose this option to zip the output file.\nOutput File Name\nName of the output file with extension. Extensions allowed: .txt, .csv\nConflict Resolution\nSpecifies how to manage conflicts when a file with the same name exists in the destination path.\nReplace - Replace the old file with the new file.\nRename - Rename the old file.\nIgnore - Retain the new file name. A new file with the same name is created.\nFail - Fails the file transfer.\nNone - System decides to either Fail or Ignore.\nPort\nThe destination SFTP port number. Generally, 22 for SFTP.\nExample use case\nRequirement:\nTransfer a file named\ntransactions.csv\nfrom the Capillary server to Brand X's server. The file should be encrypted, the delimiter should be changed from a comma (\n,\n) to a pipe (\n|\n), and header mapping needs to be done.\nSteps:\nConnect-to-source:\nHostname:\ncapillary.server.com\nUsername:\ncap_user\nPassword:\ncap_password\nRemote Path:\n/source_path/transactions.csv\nConnect-to-destination:\nHostname:\nbrandx.server.com\nUsername:\nbrandx_user\nPassword:\nbrandx_password\nRemote Path:\n/destination_path/\nCreate Remote Directory:\nYes\nZip Files:\nYes\nOutput File Name:\ntransactions.csv\nConflict Resolution:\nReplace\nPort:\n22\nDefine-headers-and-transform-data:\nHeaders Mapping:\nJSON\n{\n  \"TransAmount\": \"Transaction_value\",\n  \"BillNumber\": \"Bill_ID\"\n}\nOutput Headers Order:\nTransAmount,BillNumber\nInput File Delimiter:\n,\nOutput File Delimiter:\n|\nOutput Filename:\ntransactions.csv\nIs the file headerless?:\nNo\nEncrypt-data:\nEncryption Method:\nAES-256\nEncryption Key:\nbrandx_encryption_key\nTrigger:\nSchedule:\nDaily at 12:00 AM\nTrigger Condition:\nFile presence in the source directory\nExample Configuration\nConnect-to-source block:\nYAML\nHostname: capillary.server.com\nUsername: cap_user\nPassword: cap_password\nRemote Path: /source_path/transactions.csv\nConnect-to-destination block:\nYAML\nHostname: brandx.server.com\nUsername: brandx_user\nPassword: brandx_password\nRemote Path: /destination_path/\nCreate Remote Directory: Yes\nZip Files: Yes\nOutput File Name: transactions.csv\nConflict Resolution: Replace\nPort: 22\nDefine-headers-and-transform-data block:\nYAML\nHeaders Mapping: {\"TransAmount\": \"Transaction_value\", \"BillNumber\": \"Bill_ID\"}\nExpressions: {\"TransAmount\": \"exp{hdr'Transaction_value'+1}\"}\nOutput Headers Order: TransAmount,BillNumber\nInput File Delimiter: ,\nOutput File Delimiter: |\nOutput Filename: transactions.csv\nIs the file headerless?: No\nEncrypt-data block:\nYAML\nEncryption Method: AES-256\nEncryption Key: brandx_encryption_key\nTrigger block:\nYAML\nSchedule: Daily at 12:00 AM\nTrigger Condition: File presence in the source directory\nDetailed Explanation:\nConnect-to-source:\nThis block configures the details of the source SFTP server where the file is located.\nConnect-to-destination:\nThis block configures the details of the destination SFTP server where the file will be transferred. It includes options for creating directories, zipping files, and handling file conflicts.\nDefine-headers-and-transform-data:\nThis block handles the header mapping and data transformation. It changes column headers, modifies data using expressions, and sets the file delimiters.\nEncrypt-data:\nThis block encrypts the file using the specified encryption method and key.\nTrigger:\nThis block schedules the file transfer to occur daily and checks for the file's presence in the source directory.\nThis configuration ensures that the file is transferred securely, with the specified header mappings and delimiter changes, meeting Brand X's requirements.\nUpdated\n10 months ago\nTable of Contents\nUse case\nConfiguring SFTP to SFTP with Headers Definition\nConnect to destination\nExample use case"

For example, a movie listing API provides a catalog of movies across multiple pages. You can configure the template to call the API multiple times until all movies are retrieved or until only movies from a specific genre or year are listed.\nUse case\nScenario:\nA service-based company gathers customer reviews, ratings, and survey responses from various platforms. This feedback is crucial for understanding customer satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement. However, the data is stored in different systems, making it time-consuming to compile and analyse manually. A\nNeo API\nis created to get the customer data.\nSolution:\nThe Pull Data from API template automates customer feedback collection by retrieving data from the Neo API. It converts the raw feedback data into a clear, standardized format and delivers it to the storage location.\nConfiguring pull data from API\nTo configure the pull data from API template, follow these steps:\nIn the\nInvoke-Neo-Iteratively\nBlock\n, enter the API URL, authorisation details, API method and iteration details. For more information, refer to the document on\nInvoke Neo Iteratively\n.\nIn the\nJson-to-Csv-Converter\nblock, choose how the API data is converted to CSV format. For more information, refer to the document on\nConverting JSON to CSV\n.\nIn the\npush-files-to-s3\nblock, enter the S3 details. For more information, refer to the document on\nPush to S3\n.\nIn the\nTrigger\nblock, configure when the API is triggered. For more information, refer to the document on\nSchedule trigger\n.\nSelect\nSave and continue\nto save the changes and create a new data flow.\nThe dataflow has been created successfully.\nUpdated\nabout 1 month ago\nTable of Contents\nUse case\nConfiguring pull data from API"

The DIY template uses the Neo API extension to generate the necessary payload for API calls.\nExample scenario\nConsider a brand that wants to create rewards in bulk, including custom fields vendor details and specific status codes. The addition of custom field information is not part of the standard Add Reward Connect+ templates. However, with the DIY template, you can create a custom template that captures these additional fields, customising the rewards creation process according to their needs.\nKey benefits\nThe key benefits of using DIY template creation are:\nFlexibility in template creation: The DIY template allows you to create templates based on your specific needs without requiring developer involvement.\nReduced developer effort: The DIY template minimises developers' time and effort in creating new templates.\nCreating a Template\nBelow is a flow chart indicating the steps involved in creating a Connect+ DIY template.\nPre-requisites\nAPI tester tools like Postman or Talend\nAuthorisation credentials - Currently support Google authentication.\nActive session of the Connect+ for the respective org - The API tester retrieves credentials from an open and active session of the Connect+ portal for the respective organisation. Therefore, the Connect+ portal must remain open in a browser, active, and not timed out.\nNeo dataflow to create the payload from the JSON format available within the same organisation where you create the template.\nAPIs to create the template. The following APIs are required:\nGET workspaces\nGET processors\nPOST Create DIY template\nThe following sections guide you through the steps in creating a Connect+ template.\nCreating the structure for the template\nTo create the structure for the template,\nOpen Connect+ UI using the URL\nhttps://{host_name}.connectplus.capillarytech.com/connect/ui}/connect/ui/\nand select the organisation in which the template needs to be created.\nThis is required for authorisation.\nGet the workspace ID] using the\nGET workspaces\nAPI.\nRetrieve the blocks supported for template creation using the\nGet Processor\nAPI.\nCreate the structure of the template using the\nCreate DIY template\nAPI.\nThe template structure is created with the specified blocks after the POST method executes successfully and opens in Connect+.\nTroubleshooting\nError\nReason\nUnauthorised or Invalid credentials\nMake sure you have the correct credentials and the Connect+ UI is open.\nInvalid Workspace ID\nWorkspace ID is incorrect. Verify the workspace ID by sending a\nGET request to the workspaces\nAPI.\nInvalid Block Type\nblockType\nparameter is invalid.\nFAQs\nAt what stage do you decide which API to call based on the contents of the CSV file?\nAnswer: No specific options are available. The Neo dataflow identifies the necessary information from the CSV file contents and creates the appropriate payload for the API call.\nHow does the Neo Transformer block handle the transformation of CVS data?\nAnswer: The Transformer block converts the CSV file into JSON format. The input to the Neo Transformer block is in the JSON format.\nWhere is the payload to call the API created?\nAnswer: The Neo Transformer block creates the API payload based on the URL selected within the block.\nWhere is the Neo dataflow available?\nAnswer: The Neo dataflow must be available in the same organisation as the template being created.\nWhat happens if the first block is not a source block?\nAnswer: If the first block is not a source block, the template becomes unusable, as it lacks the information needed to fetch the source file.\nWhy do I need to open Connect+UI while running the APIs to create the template?\nAnswer: The API tester fetches the credentials from an open and active session of Connect+ UI opened for the respective organisation.\nWhat types of files can the Transform-Data block handle?\nAnswer: Currently, the Transform-Data block only supports CSV file formats. If you have a different file type, you have to convert it to CSV before uploading.\nUpdated\nabout 2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nExample scenario\nKey benefits\nCreating a Template\nPre-requisites\nCreating the structure for the template\nTroubleshooting\nFAQs"

You can download the entire report. The following table provides the list of errors that could occur when importing for transactions.\nError\nExplanation\nBill_date is invalid/null/void/of future date\nInvalid bill date.\nBill_store is invalid/null/void\nThe stores linked are not present in the system.\nbill_number repeating within X days\nX is a number between 0 and 365 (that is configurable). It decides how often a bill_number is repeatable on the same store.\nFor example, X=5, it means bill_number B1 cannot repeat on store S1 for at least 5 days.\nbill_discount > bill_gross_value\nBill Duplicate within File\nDuplicate bill_no, bill_date, and billing_store in the import file.\nBill Duplicate within database\nThis means the same bill_no, bill_date, billing_store are already present in the system (Loyalty / Non-Loyalty).\nUser Not Registered\nThe user tagged to the bill is not registered in the system.\nOutlier Status\nThe following are the different outlier statuses that you can have for a transaction.\nOutlier Status\nDescription\nNORMAL\nFor normal transactions\nFRAUD\nFor fraud transactions\nINTERNAL\nThis is for bills imported for internal use and will not be shown outside\nOUTLIER\nThis ensures the transaction is not added to the customer’s lifetime purchases\nThis article provides detailed information on how to import the following data using different profiles of the Transactions category.\nProfiles of Transactions\nPossible Errors in transaction import\nOutlier Status\nLoyalty Transactions - Transactions (Bills)\nTransactions (Not-Interested)\nTransaction Line Items (Loyalty)\nTransaction Line Items (Not Interested Transaction)\nTransaction (Returns)\nUpdate Transaction Line Items (for Loyalty Transactions)\nUpdate Transaction Line Items (for Not-interested Transactions)\nUpdate Outlier Status (Loyalty Transactions)\nUpdate Transaction Outlier Status (Not-Interested Bills)\nExtended Fields Import\nPayment Mode Import\nPayment Mode\nSupported and Mandatory Fields for each mode\nLoyalty Transactions - Transactions (Bills)\nThis profile is used to upload the transaction details of loyalty customers. The Import Framework now supports transactions of Product Bundle. A bundle can have combo items or add-on items.\nYou also need to specify outlier_status for an import; then the transaction will have normal outlier by default, meaning it is a normal transaction.\nBefore doing a transaction import, it is important to understand the billing configurations set for the organization. To know more, see Billing Configuration.\nThe following are the supported entries (CSV columns) for Loyalty Transactions.\nCustomer identifier* - mobile number/external ID/Email ID/User ID (the option you select in Choose customers' unique identifier is mandatory)\nGroup identifiers** - group ID, group external ID, primary user ID, primary user mobile, primary user email, primary user external ID, primary user card number (the option you select in User Group2 Identifier Type is mandatory).

For this, it is required to specify the respective currency conversion ratio for each transaction in the .csv file.\nTo convert transactions with local currency, it is required to set the currency of transactions that you want to import (Transaction Currency in template configuration) and the conversion ratio of each transaction (in the CSV file)\nYou can add/modify supported currencies of the org in\nOrganization Setup > Organization Profile > Edit > Supported Currencies >\nadd required currencies and save it.\nYou can have only one type of transaction currency in the CSV file you import. However, you can specify different conversion ratios for each transaction depending on customers' base currency.\nTransactions (Not-Interested)\nThis profile lets you import transactions of not interested customers, that is transactions without customer details. You can also import transactions of Product Bundle - either combo items or add-on items. To import not-interested transaction details, you need to create a CSV file with the following fields.\nTransaction Number*\nTransaction Date*\nTransaction Amount*\nTILL IUN or Store's External ID (Store Code)*\nReason or Notes\nBill Outlier Status\nTransaction Discount\nTransaction Final Amount\nExample:\nTransactionNumber,TransactionDate,TransactionAmount,TillID,LineItemType\nTrans1222,2005-10-10,300,mal1,SPLIT\nTemplate Creation\nOptions\nDescription\nDenote stores by external ids\nCheck this box if the stores of the organization use store external ids as store codes.\nReplace invalid store names with\nChoose the store that you want to replace with for invalid stores identified in the import.\nOverride amount calculation\nBy default, the final bill amount (final_amount) is calculated as  (bill_amount - discount) and stores it in the final_amount field in the database.\nCheck this if you need to consider the value provided in the import file as per the field mapping.\nDefault bill outlier status\nSet the default outlier status from the available options. The default value is Normal.\nNormal: For normal transactions.\nFraud: For fraud transactions.\nInternal: For internal or sample transactions.\nOutlier: For outlier transactions - there are not included/added in the lifetime transactions/store transactions.\nTransaction Line Items (Loyalty)\nUse this profile to upload line item details of loyalty transactions. Hence, the file should contain line-items of transactions of only loyalty customers. The Import Framework now supports transactions of Product Bundle. A bundle can have combo items or add-on items.\nItem*\nMobile no./External id/Customer unique identifier* (the option you choose in Select the user input type is mandatory)\nGroup identifiers** - group ID, group external ID, primary user ID, primary user mobile, primary user email, primary user external ID, primary user card number (the option you select in User Group2 Identifier Type is mandatory). This is required for group transactions.\nTill Username/Store external id*\nItem id/code*\nItem description\nRate*\nQuantity*\nValue (rate*quantity-discount)\nDiscount\nBill amount\nSerial no.\nTransaction date*\nCounter Id\nTransaction Number*\nPoints\nGross value (Net value)*\nOutlier Status\nLine item outlier status\nUser id\nEmail id\nLine item type (Mandatory for transactions with combo items)\nParent line item serial no. (Mandatory for transactions with combo items)\nNote:\nA line item with null or blank SKU is considered Outlier.\nFields marked with * are mandatory.\nField marked with ** is required for group transactions.\nProduct Bundle Support\nImport Framework now supports transactions with product bundle details. There are three types of produce bundle - add-on type, combo type, and split type.\nCombo\n: Bundling one or more products of the same category and selling them as a single unit. In Import, you need to pass each combo item with line item type COMBO_ITEM and the parent item with line item type REGULAR\nAdd-on:\nIt refers to a personalized product where a base product will have different add-ons. For example, pizza with cheese burst, toppings and so on. Each add-on item should be represented as ADDON_ITEM and the parent item should be represented as REGULAR\nEach combo or add-on item should be associated with a parent item (Parent Line item Serial No). Any new combo or add on items, which you import for a transaction, will be added automatically to the inventory.\nSplit Items\n: It refers to item price based on different parameters involved (break up of item price). This is mainly used for jewellery stores. For example, if a necklace is considered as the base product, the split could include store charge, making charges, wastage charges and so on. It is not necessary that the price of the base item should match with the sum of individual split items.  For a split item, Line item type should be SPLIT and the base line item type should be REGULAR\nCSV Sample:\nMobile,TransactionNumber,Til,ItemID,Rate,Quantity,TransactionDate,OutlierStatus,Value\n9900111111,TRANS122562,mal1,GB35,601,1,2005-10-10,Normal,601\nTemplate Configuration\nOption\nDescription\nDenote stores by external ids\nCheck this box if the stores of the organization use store external ids as store codes\nReplace invalid store names with\nChoose the store that you want to replace with for invalid stores identified in the import\nRegister new customers automatically\nCheck this option to allow registering new customers automatically\nAllow adding line items to the existing transactions\nCheck this option to enable line-item level transactions\nOutlier status to be considered for billing\nAdd the items that need to be considered as outlier items\nUpdate points and purchases for existing transactions\nCheck this option to update points and lifetime purchases automatically for the import\nLine item level points given\nCheck this option if the points are issued at a line item level\nAppend country code to the mobile number automatically\nCheck this box to prefix the base country code of the org's base country wherever mobile numbers without country code are identified\nIgnore currency conversion\nCheck this option to skip currency conversion even if the CSV file consists of conversion ratio.\nIgnore inventory push\nCheck this option to ignore adding/updating product details available in the CSV file.\nIgnore combo add ons\nCheck this option to ignore adding combo (add-on) details available in the CSV file.\nDisable mobile number validation\nCheck this option to disable validating customer's mobile number while importing the data\nDisable email id validation\nCheck this option to disable validating customer's email id while importing the data\nEnter email id for email notifications\nSpecify email ids to whom you want to send notifications related to the import.\nSelect the user input type\nSelect the customer identifier provided in the CSV file (mobile, email ID, external ID, or user ID).\nDisable creation of non-existing bills\nChoose the desired points expiry strategy for the current template\nAllow separate line items of same item code in a bill\nUsually, if the item code is the same, the record merges with increment in the quantity.\nCheck this option to add such items as a separate record.\nTransaction currency\nLets you convert transaction currencies to any other currencies supported by the org. (basically a customer's local currency). For this, it is required to specify the respective currency conversion ratio for each transaction in the CSV file\nNote:\nTo convert transactions with local currency, it is required to set the currency of transactions that you want to import (Transaction Currency in template configuration) and the conversion ratio of each transaction (in the CSV file)\nYou can add/modify supported currencies of the org in Organization Setup > Organization Profile > Edit > Supported Currencies > add required currencies and save it.\nYou can have only one type of transaction currency in the CSV file you import. However, you can specify different conversion ratios for each transaction depending on customers' base currency.\nYou could have an outlier status as Normal, Fraud, Internal, and Outlier. A bill and a line item can have separate outlier statuses.\nThe priority of a line item outlier status is more than the bill outlier status, and the status 'Normal' has the highest precedence. i.e. if in a bill of two or more line items, a line item has the status 'Normal', then the bill will have the status normal irrespective of the statuses of other line-items.\nEach line-item in a file should have a different Item ID. The line item that is imported should be a part of the Org’s Inventory. No new item will be added to the inventory.\nTransaction Line Items (Not Interested Transaction)\nThis profile lets you update the line-items of non-loyalty transactions. The Import Framework now supports transactions of Product Bundle. A bundle can have combo items or add-on items.\nTransaction Number*\nTransaction Date*\nBill Amount*\nItem Code*\nRate*\nQuantity (of Items purchased)*\nDiscount\nDescription\nGross Value*\nTILL IUN/Store External ID*\nSerial number in the listing\nLine item outlier status\nBill outlier status\nLine item type (Mandatory for transactions with combo items)\nParent line item serial no.

There are three types of produce bundle - add-on type, combo type, and split type.\nCombo\n: Bundling one or more products of the same category and selling them as a single unit. In Import, you need to pass each combo item with line item type COMBO_ITEM and the parent item with line item type REGULAR\nAdd-on\n: It refers to a personalized product where a base product will have different add-ons.

It is not necessary that the price of the base item should match with the sum of individual split items.  For a split item, Line item type should be SPLIT and the base line item type should be REGULAR\nCSV Sample:\nTransactionNumber,TransactionDate,Till,ItemCode,Rate,Qunatity,GrossValue,BillAmount\nTrans1224,2018-10-10,mal1,GB1474,300,1,300,300\nTemplate Configuration\nOption\nDescription\nDefault line-item outlier status\nChoose the default outlier status for line-items.\nValues: Internal, normal, invalid, outlier, failed, others\nAllow adding line-items to existing transactions\nCheck this option to allow adding line-items to the already existing transactions\nDefault bill outlier status\nChoose the default outlier status at the transaction level\nUpdate bill amount if already exists\nCheck this option to enable line-item level transactions\nDenote stores by external ids\nCheck this box if the stores of the organization use store external ids as store codes\nReplace invalid store names with\nChoose the store that you want to replace with for invalid stores identified in the import\nTransaction (Returns)\nThis profile lets you update return transactions of a customer. You can import complete return or mixed return types. Following are three different cases of a return transaction:\nCase A. Returning a transaction with amount without making a new purchase - full return transaction\nCase B. Returning a transaction or a line-item and purchasing another item on behalf - mixed transaction\nCase C.  Returning a transaction which does not exist in Capillary Database. (bill) then this flow will be followed. This depends on the configuration set at the org level for return transactions.\nThere are three types of transactions - Amount (when the transaction is returned with amount); Line-item (when a line-item of a transaction is returned, and a new item is purchased); Full (when the entire transaction is returned, and a new purchase is made).\nYou can import only one return transaction type at a time. Hence, create different CSV files for each return type and create a separate import job for each of the return types.\nAlso, once a transaction is returned as AMOUNT, then the same transaction cannot be returned with any other type (LINEITEM or FULL) again and vice versa.\nTransaction Number\nTransactionDate*\nMobile/Email/External ID/User ID (the option you select in Select the user input type is mandatory)\nReturn Transaction Number*\nTILL IUN/Store External ID*\nReturn Type* (Values: FULL/LINEITEM/AMOUNT)\nAmount*\nDiscount\nRate\nQuantity\nItem Code** (Required for line-item return)\nReturned Transaction Store\nNotes\nCredit Note Number\nCredit Note Amount\nOther custom or extended fields\nCSV Sample\nTransactionNumber,Til,TransactionDate,TransactionAmount,Attribute,Qty,Transaction Discount(Bill Discount), Serial, Item Code, Customer Int, Customer Flag\nGB1458,mal1,10/10/2005,300,Blue ,1,10,19,test12,87,Normal\nTemplate Creation\nOption\nDescription\nAllow returning non existing transactions\nCheck this option to allow transaction returns for transactions that are not available in Capillary database\nAllow updating duplicate return transactions\nCheck this option to allow updating duplicate bills of return transactions\nAllow import without parent transaction\nCheck this option to import transaction returns without any reference transaction (parent transaction)\nDisable mobile number validation\nCheck this box to disable validating customers' mobile numbers while importing transaction returns\nDisable email id validation\nCheck this box to disable validating customers' email ids while importing transaction returns\nDenote stores by external ids\nCheck this box if the stores of the organization use store external ids as store codes\nReplace invalid store names with\nChoose the store that you want to replace with for invalid stores identified in the import\nAppend country code to the mobile number automatically\nCheck this box to prefix the base country code of the org's base country wherever mobile numbers without country code are identified\nEnter email id for email notifications\nSpecify email ids to whom the notifications related to the import need to be sent\nSelect the user input type\nSelect the unique identifier of customers used in the CSV file (MOBILE/EMAIL/ETERNAL ID/USER ID)\nUpdate Transaction Line Items (for Loyalty Transactions)\nLets you update item code and description of loyalty transactions. Other fields cannot be updated.\nThe following are the fields supported for the update loyalty transaction line item profile.\nTransaction ID***\nBill Number**\nTill Code**\nBill Date**\nItem Code*\nItem Description\nNote:\nThe parameter marked with * is mandatory along with either fields marked with\nor *\n.\nThe parameter marked with *** is mandatory if Choose Identifier in Configure Template is set to the Transaction ID.\nThe parameters marked with ** are mandatory if Choose Identifier in Configure Template is set to bill_number_date_till_code.\nTemplate Configuration\nSelect Transaction ID to identify transaction by transaction number. For this, the transaction ID is a mandatory parameter in the import file.\nSelect BillNumber_Date_TillCode to identify transaction by bill number, bill date, and TILL code.\nUpdate Transaction Line Items (for Not-interested Transactions)\nLets you update item code and description of non-interested loyalty transactions.\nThe following are the fields supported for the update loyalty transaction line item profile.\nTransaction ID***\nBill Number**\nTill Code**\nBill Date**\nItem Code*\nItem Description\nNote:\nThe parameter marked with * is mandatory along with either fields marked with\nor *\n.\nThe parameter marked with *** is mandatory if Choose Identifier in Configure Template is set to the Transaction ID.\nThe parameters marked with ** are mandatory if Choose Identifier in Configure Template is set to bill_number_date_till_code.\nTemplate Configuration\nSelect Transaction ID to identify transaction by transaction number. For this, the transaction ID is a mandatory parameter in the import file.\nSelect BillNumber_Date_TillCode to identify transaction by bill number, bill date, and TILL code.\nNote:\nBill custom fields cannot be updated.\nUpdate Outlier Status (Loyalty Transactions)\n❗️\nWarning\nUpdating the outlier status will not change the loyalty KPIs such as transaction count, returns, or trackers.\nThis profile lets you update outlier status of a bill or to delete a bill (outlier status - DELETED). When you delete a bill, all the line-items associated with the bill will be removed automatically.\nUpload a CSV file with bill ids along with the outlier status.\nA line item with null or blank SKU is considered an outlier.\nThe CSV file for creating bulk outliers should contain the following fields:\nBill ID ( transaction dump id or loyalty log id)*\nOutlier status*: The following are values supported for outlier status\nOUTLIER: To mark a bill outlier\nNORMAL: To mark a bill as a valid bill\nDELETED: To delete a bill with all the associated line-items\nTemplate Configuration\nOption\nDescription\nIdentifier for updating transactions\nChoose the identifier you want to use for updating transactions - Loyalty Log ID or Bill Dump ID\nReplace invalid outlier status with\nChoose the default status that you want to have for invalid outlier statuses in the import.\nValues: Normal, Fraud, Outlier\nUpdate Transaction Outlier Status (Not-Interested Bills)\nThis profile lets you modify the outlier status of a line-item and the value of a transaction amount.

With this profile, you can import extended fields of customer, transaction, transaction line item, and lead. You cannot do both add and update of an extended field value (for a customer) in the same file/import.\nAgain, for a transaction, you can add or update extended fields for\nloyalty transactions (regular transaction, regular transaction line item, return transaction);\nnot-interested transactions (not-interested transaction, not-interested transaction line item, not-interested return transaction, not-interested line item return).\nThe following are the fields supported for each entity type.\nCustomer\nTransaction\nTransaction line item\nLead\n- Entity ID_ (customer id)\n- Extended field value 1_\n- Email ID\n- Mobile Number\n- External ID\n- Entity ID***\n- Bill Number**\n- Till Code**\n- Bill Date**\n- Email ID\n- Mobile Number\n- External ID\n- TransactExtended field values_ (Each in a different column)Note:\nEntity ID could be transaction id/line item id/return transaction id.\n* Either the field with **\nor fields with _\nare mandatory depending on the option selected in\nChoose Identifier.**\n- Entity ID***\n- Bill Number**\n- Till Code**\n- Bill Date**\n- Email ID\n- Mobile Number\n- External ID\n- Extended field values*\n- Entity ID_ (Lead ID)\n- Email ID\n- Mobile Number\n- External ID\n- Bill Number\n- Till Code\n- Bill Date\n- Extended field values_ (Each in a different column)\nSpecify each extended field value that you want to update for a customer in a different column.\nFields for customer level extended\nEntity ID* (For a customer, it is customer id (user id), and for a transaction, it is transaction id/line-item id, for lead it is lead id)\nExtended Field Value*\nBill Number*\nTill Code*\nBill Date*\nEmail ID\nMobile Number\nExternal ID\nExtended fields based on the entity type\nTemplate Creation\nOption\nDescription\nEntity Type\nAccording to the entity type uploaded, select the type of the entity.\nFor example:\nIf the entity ID is customer ID, you can update customer level extended fields. So, select Customer from the list.\nIf the entity ID is transaction/line item ID, you can update transaction/line item level extended fields. So,  select the type of transaction - regular, return, not-interested, regular line item, return line item, not-interested line item.\n* If the entity ID is lead ID, select Lead to update extended fields of Lead.\nExtended Fiealds\nAdd the fields that you want to update.\nChoose Identifier\nChoose the identifier used based on the type of external fields.\nFor transaction level extended fields, the identifier should be transaction ID.\nFor line item level extended fields it should be transaction line item ID.\nFor customer level extended fields, the identifier could be mobile, email, user id, external id.\nFor lead level extended fields, it is lead ID.\nSkip Records with Null Values\nCheck this box if you do not want null values to pass into the transformation. For example, if you select this, any null value identified for an extended field (in the CSV file) is ignored from saving.\nPayment Mode Import\nYou can now import payment mode details of existing transactions through Import Framework. For new transactions, you first need to import transactions and then update payment modes through Payment Mode Import.\nThe fields associated with each payment mode might vary depending on the brand's payment mode configurations. Hence there are no fixed fields for each payment mode.  However, the fields user id, transaction number and transaction date are mandatory for any payment mode.\nPayment Mode\nIn Select payment mode, choose the preferred mode of payment.\nCard: Payments through debit or credit card\nCheck: Payments through checks\nGift Card: Payments through store gift cards\nDiscount Coupon: Discount coupons used for payments\nExchange Lineitem: Exchanging a purchased line item\nPoints:  Payments through loyalty points\nCash on delivery: Payments through cash upon delivery\nBank credit:\nNet banking: Payments through online internet banking\nSupported and Mandatory Fields for each mode\nPayment Mode\nSupported Fields\nCard\nUser Id(User Id)\nBill Number(Bill Number)\nBill Date(Bill Date)\nPayment Mode Value(Payment Mode Value) *\nName On Card(AF)\nCardIssuerCode(AF)\nAuthorizationMethodCode(AF)\nCheck\nUser Id(User Id)\nBill Number(Bill Number)\nBill Date(Bill Date)\nPayment Mode Value\nBank Name\nBranch Name\nGift Card/ Exchange Line item/ Points/ Cash on Delivery/ Bank Credit/ Net Banking\nUser Id(User Id)\nBill Number(Bill Number)\nBill Date(Bill Date)\nPayment Mode Value\nNote:\nThe payment mode value is the amount paid through the respective payment mode\nIt is required to provide original Bill number and Bill date to process the import\nNo new transaction or line items can be added through this import\nBill Store Update\nThis profile allows you to update the store linked to a transaction using the bill ID and Till details.\nUse Case\nSuppose transaction T1 is currently associated with store S1, and you need to change the association to store S2.

This reassigns the transaction from S1 to S2.\nUpdated\n8 months ago\nTable of Contents\nPossible Errors in transaction import\nOutlier Status\nLoyalty Transactions - Transactions (Bills)\nTransactions (Not-Interested)\nTransaction Line Items (Loyalty)\nTransaction Line Items (Not Interested Transaction)\nTransaction (Returns)\nUpdate Transaction Line Items (for Loyalty Transactions)\nUpdate Transaction Line Items (for Not-interested Transactions)\nUpdate Outlier Status (Loyalty Transactions)\nUpdate Transaction Outlier Status (Not-Interested Bills)\nExtended Fields Import\nPayment Mode Import\nBill Store Update"

For example, if L1, L2, L3, and L4 are four categories from top to bottom level, you can import all categories at a time with a proper mapping or one by one from L1 to L4.  However, it is recommended to use the second case to ensure proper mapping.\nIt is important to understand the following points while configuring Profile Templates.\nAction\nBehaviour\nIf same field is selected in both update and ignore\nData will be updated\nA column is selected to update but not mapped\nField data will not be updated\nColumn not selected to update but mapped\nField data will not be updated\nUpdating item-code details for a category or brand ensuring that the Category and brand import is correct\nData will be updated\nConfiguring Organisation Unit (OU) support for product entities\nOrganisation Unit\n(OU) support for product entities enables you to use the same SKU codes for the different OUs under an organisation.\n📘\nBy default, transactions are tagged under OU. This is achieved by linking the stores where transactions occur to corresponding zones or concepts, and categorizing these zones or concepts as OUs.\nUse case\nIn your organizational setup, there are multiple organizational units (OUs) in place. By default, any inventory that's uploaded to the main organization is automatically shared among all these individual OUs.\nHowever, let's consider a situation where a particular org unit requires its own separate inventory. This necessity arises due to conflicts noticed between the SKU codes it utilizes and those uploaded by other org units.\nIn such scenarios, you have the option to enable the \"OU support for product entities\" configuration. This configuration allows the creation of distinct inventories that are specific to each specific organizational unit.\nEnabling OU support for product entities\nTo enable OU support for product entities, create a\nJIRA ticket\nand enable the config\nCONF_OU_LEVEL_PRODUCTS_ENABLED\n.`\nProduct category\nA product category is used to classify different types of products. For example, smartphones can be categories as “foldables”, “big screen”, “small screen”, “camera phone”.\nYou will have item code by default which is the lowest level. You can add up to four levels above the item code.\nAssume L4, L3, L2, L1, L0 as different levels where L0 is item code and L4 is the super parent. You need to first import a parent category followed by child category.\nYou can make a super parent category a root category using the option\nMark parent category as root if not mapped for existing categories.\nThis profile lets you update existing categories of a brand or add new child categories. To use this profile, the org should have at least one parent category under it.\nCategory Code\nParent Category Code\nCategory Name\nCategory Description\nLeave the Parent Category Code blank for parent categories and specify the respective parent category code for child categories.\nCSV Sample:\nCategory Code,Parent Category Code, Category Name,Category Description\nShirts,Apparels,categoryName,Men Apparels\nConfiguring Template\nAdd the fields that you want to allow updating for the current template, Any field that you did not add here will be ignored even if you do the field mapping\nSelect Mark parent category as root if not mapped for new categories, to enable converting a new category parent if not mapped any parent category\nSelect Mark parent category as root if not mapped for existing categories, to convert existing categories - that are not mapped to any parent category - as parent categories\nIf OU support for product inventory is enabled, select concept (OU) to map the product category to an OU.  For more information, see\nOU support for product inventory\n.\nSelect the Store access group.

For this, you need to have categories created for the Org and you can specify values of each category in the data file. To import root categories and brands use the profiles Category and Brands respectively. Please navigate to the respective sections for more details.\n_Note: _If any new category is identified in the file that you import, a category is created  without any parent mapping. Hence, if you have new categories, it is recommended to do a category import before importing inventory details.\nImportant checklist for inventory import:\nBefore importing inventory\nidentify hierarchy levels and new attributes in the file.\nItem codes are alpha-numeric and do not have special characters, spaces, blank or null values.\nItem codes are unique and no duplicate codes are available.\nAn item code is associated only to one category.\nCharacter count of item codes do not exceed 50 (Else, contact the Platform API Team to extend the character limit)\nNote:\nIf an item-code has prefix '0' or long digit value, example: 9988777665511, 00006785, it is recommended not to open the file directly on Notepad.\nYou can use only predefined attributes or custom attributes configured in InTouch > Settings > Miscellaneous > Inventory Operations > Inventory Attributes. Any unknown attribute will be ignored automatically. Make sure to configure your required attributes on the Inventory Attributes page before importing\nInventory hierarchy\nEach organization might have a different product hierarchy - it could be hierarchy levels, supported attributes, brands or any other attribute. Before starting with the import, you need to validate the data file of the organization with that of the Capillary's.\nThis profile is used to import the inventory details of stores. The CSV file should contain all the mandatory fields along with supported optional fields.\nSKU*\nEAN*\nPrice\nDescription\nBrand Code\nCategory Code\nStyle Code\nPrerequisites\nData Quality Report (DQR) to check the quality of data mapping (in percentage).\nCompare inventory item-codes with that of transaction line-items before importing.\nCSV Sample:\nSku,Ean,Price,Description,BrandCode,CategoryCode,StyleCode\n1234567,1234567,32,Pencils,Camelin,Camelinpencil2HB,PencilSytle\nConfiguring Template\nOption\nDescription\nDisable existing data updation\nCheck this box to not allow updating existing inventory details if the field value is already available. Not applicable for first time import.\nCreate brand if provided brand_code does not exist\nCheck this box to allow creating brands automatically if any new brand code (as per the Capillary database) appears in the CSV file.\nCreate category if provided category_code does not exist\nCheck this box to allow creating categories automatically if a new category code (that is not in the Capillary database) is identified in the CSV file\nCreate style if provided style_code does not exist\nCheck this box to allow creating styles automatically if any style code provided in the CSV file does not exist in the database.\nSelect fields to be ignored if invalid\nAdd fields that you want to ignore from updating in case of invalid field names identified in the CSV file.\nSelect concept\nIf OU support for product inventory is enabled, select concept (OU) to map the product category to an OU.  For more information, see\nOU support for product inventory\n.\nSelect fields to be updated\nAdd fields that you want to update in the current import. Any other field that is available in the CSV file will be ignored even if you do the field mapping.\nDisable updation of custom fields with empty values\nCheck this box to not allow updating custom field values with null values if found in the csv file\nUpdate Inventory Line-items\nThis profile lets you update line-item ids (item codes) in the loyalty_bill_lineitems table. Use this profile to update item ids that are wrongly entered or with null values.\nLine-item id\nItem Code\nPrerequisites\nCompare inventory item-codes with that of transaction line-items before importing\nCSV Sample\nLine Item Id, Item Code\n9970661,GB58\nConfiguring Template\nCheck the Update the existing item code box to allow updating existing item codes with the new values in the csv file and click Submit.\nAdd Brands\nThis profile lets you add child brands, or update existing brands. To use this profile, the org should have configured at least with one parent brand.\nBrand Code\nBrand Parent Code\nBrand Name\nBrand Description\nCSV Sample:\nBrand Code,Parent Brand Code, Brand Name,Brand  Description\nShirts,Apparels,Brand Name,Men Apparels\nConfiguring Template\nAdd the fields that you want to include for the current profile template and click Submit to save the template.\n* Mark parent brand as root if not mapped for new brands:\nCheck this option to make new parent brands of the current import as root brands.\nMark parent brand as root if not mapped for existing brands\n: Check this option to make existing parent brands as root brands through the current import.\nIf OU support for product inventory is enabled, select concept (OU) to map the product category to an OU. For more information, see\nOU support for product inventory\n.\nAdd product attributes\nThis profile lets you add or update product attributes.

Hence, when you fetch details, the system no longer appends the timestamp to promotion name (as earlier), but retains the name that you specified.\nImport on group primary identifier\nSet this option to Yes for user group import and use the identifier of the primary member of the group to identify the group.\nSet user defined promotion identifier\nCheck this if you want to use an external identifier for the promotion and enter the identifier in the text box that appears.\nWhen you provide a  new identifier, a new promotion is created with the given identifier and name.\nWhen you provide an existing identifier, points will be awarded under the existing promotion.\nNOTE:  Ensure you provide the same promotion name when using an existing promotion identifier. If there is a mismatch, the system will throw an error.\n📘\nIt is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import.\nFor example, if you want to deduct 300 points from a transaction for which 500 points are issued, you will pass points to be deducted as 300. What will happen to the points issued for that customer?\nAs per the transaction, we cannot expire partial points, the entire points of the transaction (500) will be expired first and 200 points (500-300) will be issued again. In this, the total issued points will be 700 (500+200). However, points for individual line items will be deducted according to the expiry dates.\nManual Points Adjustment\nThis profile lets you deduct points from customers accounts manually. There can be erroneous scenarios where brands want to deduct some points from customers.\nFor example : A transaction was done and the brand imported the points with the bill_id. Now when a customer returns the bill via a credit card of let's say HDFC, HDFC doesn’t know what was the original bill. And hence there is no way to link the original and the return bill. In such cases, HDFC would want to create a new PA entry with all points as returned. This will be similar to negative PA entry but only the return value will be -ve. Thus overall the points will be reduced for the customer.\nToday in our system, points can be deducted in three ways : Redeemed, expired and returned.\nIn this case, the points will be considered as returned.\nUser identifiers like mobile , userId, externalId etc,\nReason for manual adjustment\nPoints to deduct\nOptional fields can be program_id, promotion_id, promotion_external_identifier and points awarded_id\nOption\nDescription\nChoose customers' unique identifier\nCustomer for whom points need to be deducted. User identifiers like mobile , userId, externalId etc\nIdentification of source\nChoose whether the\nAll programs of the org\nIn case of MLP, this is the list of programs. Choose the program in which points need to be deducted.\nReference id for points adjustment\nChoose from points awarded_id, promotion_id or promotion_identifier. The points will be deducted as returned against that pa_id, the points which are getting expired will be checked and deducted in case of promotion_id & the points getting expired will be deducted in case of promotion identifier(here program id is mandatory).\nUser Group2 Enabled\nCheck this, if points are to be deducted from a group. Pass the unique identifier for points deduction.\nDenote stores by external ids\nCheck this box if the stores of the organization use store external ids as store codes\nReplace invalid store names with\nChoose the store that you want to replace with wherever invalid stores are identified\nRefer here for more details -\nTechnical document\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nBill Promotion Expiry\nCustomer Promotion Expiry\nTransactions Bills Deduction\nManual Points Adjustment"

It is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import.\nExample:\nConsider Blue Purple(org) loyalty program is having 12 months of points validity for a list of customers which they want to change to 24 months. In such case, you can select the extended expiry type and use the relative point expiry option to update the point expiry duration from 12 to 24 months.\nFacts\nDate & duration\nCurrent date\nAugust 01, 2021\nActual point expiry date\nJuly 31, 2022 (12 months from current date)\nExtended point expiry date\nJuly 31, 2023  (24 months from current date)\nCSV Fields\nCustomer identifier (User ID/External ID/Email/Mobile/Card Number)*\nCSV Sample using User ID\n:\nUser Id\n1250755\nTemplate configuration\nOption\nDescription\nChoose customer's unique identifier\nChoose the unique customer identifier used in the CSV to identify customers.\nUSER_ID\nMOBILE\nEMAIL\nEXTERNAL_ID\nCARD_NUMBER\nProgram Name\nSelect the loyalty program name for which you want to update the point expiry date.\nSelect start date -\nSelect end date\nSet the duration for which you want to update the expiry date. Any points that are expiring in the specified duration will be updated as per the new expiry date you set.\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Type\nChoose your preferred type for points update.\nEarly expiry\n: Select this option to expire points before the actual expiry date.\nFor example, If the actual point expiry date is August 30, 2021, then the early expiry date must be before August 30, 2021.\nExtended expiry\n: Select this option to extend the expiry date from the actual expiry date.\nFor example, If the actual point expiry date is August 30, 2021, then the extended expiry date must be after August 30, 2021.\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Note\nEnter the reason for updating the point expiry date.\nSet expiry date to\nChoose the expiry date from the following options.\nFixed date expiry\n: Set a date on which you want to expire the points. Fixed date expiry must be greater than the current date.\nFor example, If the current date is August 29, 2021, then the fixed date expiry must start from August 30, 2021\nRelative date expiry\n: Set the number of days or months after which the points will expire.\nFor example, If the current date is July 29, 2021(today) and you set the expiry count to 5 days then the point expiry date will be August 02, 2021.\n*\nImmediate expiry\n: Select this option if you want the points to be expired immediately(the moment system has successfully updated the point expiry using data import.\nExpire Promised Points\nSelect this to expire promised points.\nUpdate Points Expiry (PointsType & RefID)\nThis profile lets you modify the points expiry of a customer based on Point Awarded Reference Type and Point Awarded Reference ID. It is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import.\nExample\n:\nConsider there are five customers in an org with different reasons to update their point expiry and you want to update customer 1, customer 2, and rest customers(customer 3, 4, and 5) with different expiry type(extended or early expiry) and date(fixed, relative, or immediate).\nUse case 1 -  Update expiry for a customers with point awarded reference ID\nConsider customer 1 has accidentally received points with a incorrect validly (incorrect validity awarded - 4 months, correct validity should be - 6 months). In this case, you can update customer 1 with an extended points expiry of 2 months(relative) using point awarded reference ID.\nNote: When point awarded reference ID is mentioned then you also have to mention point awarded reference type in the csv file.\nFacts\nDate & duration\nCurrent date\nAugust 01, 2021\nIncorrect point expiry date\nSeptember 31, 2021 (31 days from current date)\nExtended point expiry date\nOctober 31, 2021 (After 2 months from incorrect point expiry date)\nUse case 2 -  Update expiry for a customers with point awarded reference type\nConsider customer 1 has 100 points that are going to expire on August 31, 2021 but the store will be closed from August 22, 2021 to August 31, 2021(10 days) due to store redesigning. In this case, you can update customer 2 with an extended points expiry of 10 days(relative) using point awarded reference type.\nFacts\nDate & duration\nCurrent date\nAugust 01, 2021\nActual point expiry date\nAugust 31, 2021 (31 days from current date)\nExtended point expiry date\nSeptember 09, 2021 (Points expiring after 10 days from actual point expiry date)\nUse case 3 -  Update expiry for a list of customers\nConsider customer 3, 4, and 5 have 100 points each that are going to expire on September 30, 2021 but the store will be closed permanently after August 31, 2021 due to business failure. In this case, you can update customer 3, 4, and 5 with an early points expiry date - August 31, 2021(fixed).\nFacts\nDate & duration\nCurrent date\nAugust 01, 2021\nActual point expiry date\nSeptember 30, 2021\nEarly point expiry date\nAugust 31, 2021 (Points expiring before actual point expiry date)\nThe following are fields of the csv file.\nCustomer identifier (User ID/External ID/Email/Mobile/Card Number)*\nPoint Awarded Ref Type*\nPoint Awarded Ref ID*\nExpiry Type*\nExpiry Unit*\nExpiry Value*\nExpiry Update Reason Type*\nExpiry Update Reason Note\nCSV Sample using User ID\n:\nUser Id,Point Awarded Ref Type,Point Awarded Ref Id,Expiry Type,Expiry Unit,New Expiry Value,Expiry Update Reason Type,Expiry Update Reason Note\n235233,POINTS_AWARDED,134435,relative,months,12,Extend_Expiry,Covid\nTemplate configuration\nOption\nDescription\nChoose customer's unique identifier\nChoose the unique customer identifier used in the CSV to identify customers.\nUSER_ID\nMOBILE\nEMAIL\nEXTERNAL_ID\n* CARD_NUMBER\nChoose Program Name\nSelect the loyalty program for which you want to update the point expiry date of a customer.\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Type\nChoose your preferred type for points update.\nEarly expiry\n: Select this option to expire points before the actual expiry date.\nFor example, If the actual point expiry date is August 30, 2021, then the early expiry date must be before August 30, 2021.\nExtended expiry\n: Select this option to extend the expiry date from the actual expiry date.\nFor example, If the actual point expiry date is August 30, 2021, then the extended expiry date must be after August 30, 2021.\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Note\nEnter the reason for updating the point expiry date/days/months.\nExpire promised points\nSelect this to expire promised points.\nUpdate Points Expiry (using Promotion ID)\nThis profile lets you update the points expiry of a customer based on Loyalty Promotion ID.\nIt is very important to understand how the issued and expired points will be affected by this import.\nExample\n:\nConsider that 100 promotional points wrongly awarded to 10 customers of an org. Now the org want to remove the promotional points from all 10 customers. In such case, you can select the promotion and use the customer identifier(User ID/External ID/Email/Mobile/Card Number) to change the expiry type(early expiry) and date(immediately).\nFacts\nDate & duration\nEarly point expiry date\nImmediate expiry (on the date of data import)\nCustomer identifier (User ID/External ID/Email/Mobile/Card Number)*\nCSV Sample using User ID:\nUser Id\n1250755\nTemplate configuration\nOption\nDescription\nChoose customer's unique identifier\nChoose the unique customer identifier used in the CSV to identify customers.\nUSER_ID\nMOBILE\nEMAIL\nEXTERNAL_ID\n* CARD_NUMBER\nProgram Name\nSelect the loyalty program for which you want to update the point expiry date of a customer.\nSelect Promotion\nSelect the promotion for which you want to update the point expiry date of a customer.\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Type\nChoose your preferred type for points update.\nEarly expiry\n: Select this option to expire points before the actual expiry date.\nFor example, If the actual point expiry date is August 30, 2021, then the early expiry date must be before August 30, 2021.\nExtended expiry\n: Select this option to extend the expiry date from the actual expiry date.\nFor example, If the actual point expiry date is August 30, 2021, then the extended expiry date must be after August 30, 2021.\nSelect Expiry Update Reason Note\nEnter the reason for updating the point expiry date.\nSet expiry date to\nChoose the expiry date from the following options.\nFixed date expiry\n: Set a date on which you want to expire the points.

Once an event notification is configured, brands can build custom solutions to trigger for pre-configured actions.\nEvent Notifications are sent through Webhooks configured in Capillary Event Notifications. The following is the top-level diagram, of the Events Notification framework (ENS).\nUse Cases\nThere are several use cases of event notifications. A couple of examples are provided in the following.\nEnable PII-less Communication\nIn some cases, brands prefer not to send customers' personally identifiable information (PII data) such as names, email ID, and mobile number to Capillary and manage communication completely at their end. Event Notification can be used to get the events that require communication such as customer registration, transaction, points issual, points redemption, points transfer, etc. On receiving these events, clients can send communication to customers with their names and identifiers as needed.\nIntegration with 3rd Party Applications\nEvent notification can be used to build integrations with 3rd party applications. For example, send a survey link to a customer post transaction event from a survey application such as Medallia; sync customer’s loyalty information to an e-commerce platform such as Magento. Integration can be built to receive real-time events, enrich information using Capillary APIs (if required), and sync it to the 3rd party application using the brand's APIs.\nSteps involved in ENS set up\nThe following are the steps involved in the set up of the Event Notification Service (ENS) for a client.\nWebhook creation\nWebhooks let you create an integration URL that is required to post events data from ENS to Webhook. Before starting with the configuration process, you need to create a Webhook account and generate a URL. The URL is further used to post events generated by the client (This can be done by creating an API proxy for API Gateway such as Apigee).\nEvent Notification Configuration\nOnce you have the Webhook URL, you need to subscribe to the events that need to be notified. This can be done either through UI or API. For more details, see\nAdd Event Notification\nEvent Consumption\nOnce the setup is completed, the client can consume and process events data and use the data to configure actions to trigger. For more details see,\nConsuming event notification\nAt present notification the following event notifcations can be configured:\nrewardIssued\n: Notification that a reward has been issued to a

To get a Webhook URL, you need to have a Webhook account. You can use the URL generated for the account to configure event notifications.\nIn\nHeader\n, enter the required headers (for integration authentication) as keys and values required to authenticate event notification.\nIn\nPayload enrichment settings\n, select the entries that you want to capture in the current notification. This provides better data enrichment by including the selected entry parameters in the payload.\n📘\nNote\nBy default, the customer identifiers are not available in the event notification payload. The presence of identifiers in the payload depends on:\nHow the API was called - the identifier used to make the API call will be included in the payload\nWhether identifier enrichment is explicitly enabled\nSelect Till to capture till details - till data enrichment. The payload will contain till details such as till code, till name, and till ID.\nSelect Store to capture store details - store data enrichment. The payload will contain store details such as store name, store ID, store code, and store external ID.\nBy default, the customer identifiers are not available in the event notification payload. The presence of identifiers in the payload depends on:\nHow the API was called - the identifier used to make the API call will be included in the payload\nWhether identifier enrichment is explicitly enabled.\nTo include a customer identifier in the payload, select Customer identifier to capture customer identifiers according to the selected source - customer data enrichment. You will see the Source drop-down as shown in the following screenshots. Select the source identifier that you want to capture. The available options are WeChat, WebEngage, and InStore. For example, if you select Instore and the Instore profile of the customer contains an external ID, mobile and email, the event response payload will include the identifiers external ID, mobile and email.\nIncluding card information along with the customer identifier information - You can select the\nCard Number\nto include card details of the customer in the event payload. An associated source (channel or source from which the card number is obtained or linked to a customer's profile) must be selected before selecting the Card Number check box. If the customer has multiple card numbers, all the card numbers are added.\nThe awarded Reference ID is a unique identifier associated with each issued point or redemption transaction within the system. These IDs are generated upon awarding loyalty points and can be used to track points issuance and redemption activities. In this context, you can select the Awarded Reference ID checkbox to capture the reference ID of the points issued as a result of the behavioural events.\nAvailable Points Balance: To capture the total available points across multiple program IDs the customer is associated with, you can raise a JIRA ticket to the sustenance team and enable the configuration\navailablePointsBalanceEnrichmentEnabled\n. Once activated, the system automatically records the customer's total points balance across\npointsIssued\nand\npointsRedeemed\nevents in the\nAvailablePointsBalance\nfield.\nIn\nAdvanced Settings\n, you can configure the following.\nMaximum allowed connections: Set the maximum number of concurrent webhook calls that could be allowed.\nDelivery SLA (in seconds): Set the expected delivery time of the event notification in seconds.

To make sure that the event notifications are delivered to the Webhook’s configured URL, Capillary analyses these failures and executes the retries accordingly.\nThe failures are classified into two categories:\nNon-Retriable\nRetriable.\nNon-retriable failures\nNon-Retriable failures include issues such as\n400 Bad Request errors\n, which are unrecoverable, regardless of the number of retry attempts made. As a result, these events are permanently marked as failures and are not subject to further retry.\nRetriable failures\nRetriable failures, such as\n429 Too Many Request errors\n, are not specific to individual events but rather are based on the overall load or traffic of requests being sent to the system.\nWhen there are retrievable failures, the system uses a retry mechanism instead of continuously checking for new events. This mechanism involves resending the same event that encountered the failure for processing. This approach gives the system a chance to recover from Retriable failures caused by high request loads without overloading it with repeated requests\nThe retry strategy used includes exponential backoff. Exponential backoff is a delay strategy where the system waits for extended periods before attempting to resend the event. This helps prevent overwhelming the system with repeated requests.\nThis retry strategy continues for at least 7 days. During this time, the system keeps attempting to process the failed event. If it still cannot process, after this duration, it moves on to the next event in the processing queue.\nYou can access detailed event information, including its current status, statistics, and detailed error messages in the event of a failure, through the event's log API endpoint, using the unique requestId associated with that particular event. For more information, refer to the documentation\nTracking Request\n.\nIdempotency Check\nA timed-out event is an event that is received by the server, but a successful response is not sent back to Capillary. The event is again sent to the Webhook URL. Hence, Hence, the integration backend or server should be able to handle the same event multiple times.\nA duplicate event can be identified by the “eventId” parameter in the event payload:\nJSON\n{\n\"eventName\": “customerAdded”,\n\"eventId\": “GSjhsJ87484SdghD4747”,\n“orgId”: 1655\n“refId”: “1655_684494987”,\n“apiRequestId”: “sdjsj78378d3287”,\n\"createdAt\": 156474848484,\n}\n📘\nIf there is a duplicate eventId, the event should be ignored.\nData Enrichment\nEvent payload contains short and optimal information. It does not contain complete information about its entities. For example, a transaction event contains identifiers and basic transaction information but does not contain other information such as custom fields, extended fields, or line item level information. To get complete information about an entity, you need to use the respective APIs.\nRefer to Event Payload to view the list of events and fields that are sent in the event notification.\nChange Data Capture\nUpdate events such as customerUpdated, and transactionUpdated only notify that some update has occurred in the associated entities, but not contain information about the change in the entities. To identify the exact change, the integration service needs to call the respective APIs.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nAuthentication\nHandling event notification failures\nNon-retriable failures\nRetriable failures\nIdempotency Check\nData Enrichment\nChange Data Capture"

But there is no event notification for such instances. To understand with an example:\nStep 1: Milestone on lifetime purchases created, and milestone value is 10,000.\nStep 2: Customer made a transaction worth 3000.\nStep 3: Customer’s milestone achieved value increased from 0 → 3000\nStep 4: Brand will get an event notification about the above step.\nStep 5: After days, the customer returned the purchase of step-2.\nStep 6: Now the milestone achieved value will decrease from 3000 → 0.\nStep 7: But brands/customers are not getting any event notification of the same.\nNow, with this latest enhancement, brands will get notified even in the case of return transactions about the decreased milestone value.\nFollowing example shows the value in the notification:\nIf the “Name” key is “ReturnBill”, it’s a return transaction where milestone value is decreased by the “currentEventTargetValue” (400 here). We are not returning negative since it can lead to integration issues.\nBadges\nEvent notifications on earning a badge (badgeEarned)\nNotifies when a badge is earned by a user.\nJSON\n{\n    \"eventName\": \"badgeEarned\",\n    \"eventId\": \"72fe1900-a413-42d6-9582-f955474739aa\",\n    \"orgId\": 50933,\n    \"refId\": \"50933_651bb7bac983d041efbc78fc\",\n    \"apiRequestId\": \"e4397e00-de8d-4a54-b86b-affe305406cb\",\n    \"createdAt\": 1696315322593,\n    \"data\": {\n        \"customerIdentifiers\": {\n            \"customerId\": 381921157,\n            \"loyaltyType\": \"loyalty\",\n            \"instore\": {\n                \"mobile\": \"918811992995\",\n                \"email\": \"\n[email protected]\n\",\n                \"externalId\": \"5a1111cfc5e3239dc0b92cc410cb28\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"badgeId\": \"650c0896aefcde237f3dba43\",\n        \"earnId\": \"651bb7bac983d041efbc78fc\",\n        \"earnedOn\": 1696315322450,\n        \"earnConstraints\": [\n            {\n                \"constraintLevel\": \"BADGE\",\n                \"constraintType\": \"OVERALL\",\n                \"maxEarnLimit\": 1000,\n                \"currentEarnCount\": 5\n            },\n            {\n                \"constraintLevel\": \"BADGE\",\n                \"constraintType\": \"ROLLING_WINDOW\",\n                \"rollType\": \"DAYS\",\n                \"rollValue\": 7,\n                \"maxEarnLimit\": 300,\n                \"currentEarnCount\": 2\n            },\n            {\n                \"constraintLevel\": \"CUSTOMER\",\n                \"constraintType\": \"ROLLING_WINDOW\",\n                \"rollType\": \"DAYS\",\n                \"rollValue\": 5,\n                \"maxEarnLimit\": 50,\n                \"currentEarnCount\": 2\n            },\n            {\n                \"constraintLevel\": \"CUSTOMER\",\n                \"constraintType\": \"ROLLING_WINDOW\",\n                \"rollType\": \"WEEKS\",\n                \"rollValue\": 1,\n                \"maxEarnLimit\": 100,\n                \"currentEarnCount\": 2\n            },\n            {\n                \"constraintLevel\": \"CUSTOMER\",\n                \"constraintType\": \"ROLLING_WINDOW\",\n                \"rollType\": \"MONTHS\",\n                \"rollValue\": 1,\n                \"maxEarnLimit\": 200,\n                \"currentEarnCount\": 5\n            },\n            {\n                \"constraintLevel\": \"CUSTOMER\",\n                \"constraintType\": \"NONE\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"triggeringActivity\": {\n            \"identifiers\": [],\n            \"enteredBy\": {\n                \"id\": 50660494,\n                \"till\": {\n                    \"code\": \"shubham.test123\",\n                    \"name\": \"shubham.test123\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"additionalAttributes\": []\n        }\n    },\n    \"loyaltyEventId\": null\n}\nAdvanced request workflow (requestWorkflowEvent)\nNotifies when a request is initiated.

Along with these, filters are created or updated; resulting in continually improved fraud detection algorithms and an enhanced knowledge base.\nFraud Detection Methodologies\nThe Engineering team creates a fraud template using the methodologies provided herein. You can create an export template for the fraud customer to download fraud customer details.\nFraud Detection Methodologies\nVintage and Visit\nVintage is the number of days since the first transaction date, and Visit is the number of times the customer\nhas come to the store. The KPI for this rule is (Vintage) / (Visit) which must be less than a predefined threshold value to get the fraud status.\nTransaction hours count in a day\nThe customers will be prone to have fraud status if he crosses a predefined number of transactions in a day (transactions count here is the distinct transaction hours in a day).\nTransaction Amount Limit\nThe system will trigger out transactions having amount more than the predefined threshold, and that\nparticular customer will be tagged as 'Fraud'.\nTop Customer Percentile\nThe rank of a customer is sorted in descending order of lifetime purchase. Customers that have 0.1 percentile would have a higher probability of making fraud by entering other's transactions into their account.\nTransactions in different zones on the same day\nTransaction Happening in 2 different regions/zones on the same day or with a gap of 6 hours, i.e., customers having transactions more than 1 in a day in different zones are prone to be tagged as a fraud. There would be very few customers with purchases in 2 different regions on the same day.\nVisits and Latency\nFor Visits, refer to rule number 1.\nThe Latency has been defined as (last bill date – joined date)/ (visits – 1). The chances of a customer being a fraud are high if his visits are more than the predefined value and have a lower latency of visit than the predefined value.\nSpike in Transaction Amounts\nIf any transactions amount is more than ten times the average transaction amount, there is a high possibility that the particular customer is doing fraud.\nTransaction per Day\nThe maximum number of transactions in a day should be less than a predefined critical value.\nTransaction per Week\nThe maximum number of transactions in a week should be less than a predefined critical value.\nLatency of Redemption\nThe Latency of redemption has been defined as (max date of redemption – min date of redemption) / (# unique days where points got redeemed– 1).\nIf the number of redeemed visits is more than a predefined value and the latency of redemption is less than a predefined value; then there are high chances of fraud.\nNumber of times points are redeemed\nThe number of times the customer has redeemed points should be more than the predefined value to mark fraud.\nRedemption Rate\nThe ratio of points redeemed visit days to points awarded visit days should be more than a predefined value to mark a particular customer fraud.\nTotal Points Redeemed\nIf the total points redeemed by the customer is more than a critical value, he is more prone to fraud.\nFraud Handling Process\nDetection is based on heuristics defined in Fraud detection rules.\nEach rule will be given weight from 0 -1. This weight will affect the importance of the rule in the\ntotal scoring.\nOnly those customers having a total score >= a predefined critical value are marked as fraud.\nIn most cases, the total score is around 1.5.\nCustomers have tagged fraud who violates at least two rules.\nThe system can reassign each customer to one of the following statuses - MARKED, CONFIRMED, RECONFIRMED, NOT FRAUD, INTERNAL. Customers marked as CONFIRMED, RECONFIRMED, or INTERNAL will have some restrictions.\nReflections of Fraud Users\nExclude their information from all the reports.\nDo not issue vouchers.\nDo not allow mobile number change from those customers.\nNot able to redeem points.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nFraud Tagging across Verticals\nFraud tagging based on purchase behavior\nFraud Detection Methodologies\nFraud Detection Methodologies\nVintage and Visit\nTransaction hours count in a day\nTransaction Amount Limit\nTop Customer Percentile\nTransactions in different zones on the same day\nVisits and Latency\nSpike in Transaction Amounts\nTransaction per Day\nTransaction per Week\nLatency of Redemption\nNumber of times points are redeemed\nRedemption Rate\nTotal Points Redeemed\nFraud Handling Process\nReflections of Fraud Users"

For example, tasks carried out to complete the customer identification change process.\nStandard workflow: A standard request workflow is a workflow that is readily available to all brands by default and is created by the Capillary product/tech team as a generic workflow that can cater to the requirements of most brands.\nCustom workflow:\nA tailored workflow designed specifically for a brand when the standard workflow does not meet its unique requirements. This custom workflow is developed with the assistance of the Capillary Solutions team to address the brand's specific needs.\nAction:\nAn action refers to any operation or task performed by an Admin user to a Customer’s profile or on the Capillary platform. For example, tasks such as changing customer status, redeeming points, issuing goodwill points, earning badges, or other critical operations.\nMarker:\nA maker is a user role responsible for initiating and submitting a request or action. The maker creates and submits tasks such as changing customer status, redeeming points, or issuing goodwill points.\nChecker:\nA checker is a user role responsible for reviewing and approving or rejecting requests or actions initiated by the maker. The checker ensures that the submitted tasks, such as changing customer status, redeeming points, or issuing goodwill points, meet the necessary criteria.\nOverview\nA brand can have different business operations, and depending on the nature of their business and loyalty program setup, you may need to restrict certain admin user actions on the Capillary platform. A typical way of gate-keeping user actions is maker-checker-based workflow - wherein certain Admin users with “maker” permissions can raise a request & others with “Checker” permissions are tasked with evaluating the requests & approving or rejecting them.\nAs of now, the Capillary platform supports Maker-checker workflows on Membercare for the following workflows:\nIdentifier Change - Mobile, Email, External ID\nGoodwill points\nGoodwill coupons\nPII Deletion\nAccount Merge\nRetro-transaction claims\nWith the new request workflow framework; brands can now incorporate different request workflows (maker-checker-based workflows) on the platform.\nAt present, the following requests are supported using the new request framework:\nEarn badge\nPoints redeem\nCustomer status change\nGoodwill points\nRetro-transaction claims\nIssue Badge\nThe new request workflow framework offers ready-to-use standard workflow to cater to the needs of the majority of the requirements of the brand.\nIn case, the standard workflows don’t meet a brand’s requirements; you can contact the Capillary solutions team to create custom workflows tailored to meet your needs. A custom workflow supports complex use cases in a workflow such as multiple approval workflows and validation-based workflows. Extension-based validations can also be configured as a part of a workflow.\nThe audit logging of the requests can be performed using the request workflow APIs. A request ID is created for every request, allowing you to retrieve the associated details using this ID.\n📘\nNotes\nAt present, there are two request workflows for Goodwill points & Retro-transaction claims.  In the future releases, all the existing Orgs from the older workflows will be migrated to the newer workflow.\nReporting on the new requests is still not available on Insights and will be available in te future releases.\nYou can configure the request workflows at\nMember Care > Settings > Request workflows\n.\nUpdated\n10 months ago\nTable of Contents\nRequest-workflow specific terms\nOverview"

The Capillary product/tech team developed it to fulfil the common criteria of most brands.\nCustom Workflow: A customized workflow is a set of tasks created exclusively for a brand. When the standard workflow fails to fulfil a brand's specific requirements, the Capillary Solutions team creates a custom workflow to address those needs\nHow do I decide whether to use a standard workflow or opt for a custom workflow?\nSelect a standard process if your brand's needs are similar to those met by the platform's established workflows. These ready-to-use workflows are intended to serve the majority of companies and can efficiently manage typical processes without the need for further customization.\nOpt a Custom Workflow if your brand has unique requirements not covered by typical processes, consider creating a custom workflow. Custom workflows are best suited for complex use cases that require numerous approval phases, validation-based processes, or extension-based validation. In such circumstances, you can contact the Capillary Solutions team to create a custom procedure that meets your specific requirements.\nCan you provide examples of scenarios where a custom workflow would be more beneficial than a standard one? Implementation and Integration.\nScenario: Your brand has distinct operational requirements or business regulations not met by standard workflows. For example, in multiple-approval workflows, auto-approval is set for a certain points range; another range requires approval by a senior resource, and for a certain range, a senior manager’s approval is required.\nImplementation & Integration: By collaborating with the Capillary Solutions team, you can create custom workflows         tailored to your brand's unique requirements, ensuring that all processes are optimized and aligned with your business goals.\nWhat parameters can be customized within a standard workflow to fit our brand’s specific needs?\nRequest auto-approval: If your brand wants specific requests to be authorized automatically, this option can be modified accordingly.\nGoodwill point limit: You can choose a maximum number of Goodwill points that can be requested.\nCan we prepare a report of the submitted requests on Insights?\nReporting on the new requests is still not available on Insights and will be available in the future releases.\nHow can I access audit logs for requests processed through the new workflow framework?\nThe audit logging of the requests can be performed using the request workflow APIs. A request ID is created for every request, allowing you to retrieve the associated details using this ID.\nHow will existing organizations using older workflows for Goodwill points and retro-transaction claims transition to the new request framework?\nTransitioning existing organizations using older workflows for goodwill points and retro-transaction claims to the new request framework is planned for future releases. This migration will ensure that all organizations benefit from the enhanced features and capabilities of the new workflow system.\nUpdated\n8 months ago"
