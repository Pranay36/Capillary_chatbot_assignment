Example, SMS, Email, WeChat, Line, Mobile Push.\nCustom Dimension\nCustom dimension is a specific dimension, which can be created through banding on dimension tables. For example, recency can be created on user dimension by applying banding on user.last_transaction_date.\nCustomer Segmentation\nCustomer Segmentation is the process of logical grouping customers based on shared characteristics, allowing brands to tailor their marketing efforts effectively. Segmentation is typically done based on demographics or customer behavior, and it helps brands understand their customers better and target them with more personalized and relevant marketing strategies.\nDimensions\nDimensions are metadata associated with an event. Facts consist of events data, but when these associated with an attribute it is called dimension. For example, transactions (fact) of a specific store, and registrations (fact) of a specific date. Here store and date become dimensions respectively.\nFacts\nA fact table consists of measures, metrics or facts of a business process. In simple terms, fact consists of event data such as transactions, points awarded, points deducted (expired, redeemed, or returned), customer registration, and slab upgrade.\nKPI\nA Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a specific metric that reflects how effectively your organization achieves its key business objectives. It is used to measure the performance of the key business objectives. For example, percentage sales, average transaction value, average basket value, member transactions and so on. You can see the entire set of KPIs supported in EI on the Library > KPIs page.\nMetric Dimension\nMetric dimensions are banding on columns and are measurable by nature. For example, bill amount and discount.\nMigration Chart\nA particular type of chart that helps track the migration of users from one slab or segment to another slab or segment.\nNon-SCD\nNon-SCD; or Non-Slowly Changing Dimension, is a type of customer segmentation where the behavior of customers is not tracked and only the current snapshot of the customer list is maintained. The system stores only the recently updated time and does not maintain the tracking history of previous updates. Whereas SCD segments track the behavior of customers at a given point in time. SCD segments are usually used for migration charts.\nNPS\nNet Promoter Score; or NPS, is (Promoters-Detractors)/Total number of NPS responses.\nReport\nA report is a combination of charts that provides essential insights into a business based on the KPIs and Dimensions selected for each chart.\nSCD\nSCD, or Slowly Changing Dimension is a type of customer segmentation in which the behavior of customers is tracked at a given point in time. SCD segments are usually used for migration charts. Whereas in Non-SCD, the behaviour of customers is not tracked and only the current snapshot of the customer list is maintained.\nThe system stores only the recently updated time and does not maintain the tracking history of previous updates.\nETL Sync\nETL Sync is the process of Extracting data from the production database (OLTP*), Transforming it into a structured format, and Loading it into the OLAP database*. This process typically occurs during the night for each cluster. For instance, the EU cluster's refresh begins around 2200 HRS GMT. Data is refreshed every 24 hours and applies to all reporting and analytics functions across the Capillary platform—for example, audience lists, Insights reporting and so on.\n*Online Analytical Processing Database - OLAP systems are a type of data warehouse system that helps analyse and report large volumes of data. For example, to analyze sales transactions over a period of time.\n*Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) - OLTP is a type of database system that is used to process a large number of transactions simultaneously.\nUpdated\n8 months ago"

KPIs and dimensions are one of the building blocks of Insights+.\nSuggest Edits\nKPI\nA Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a specific metric that reflects how effectively your organization achieves its key business objectives. KPIs are displayed using the data ingested on Insights+.\nFor example, KPIs such as Points redeemed, Total spent, etc give you information about the points redeemed by the customer and total spend by the customer.\n🚧\nNote\nTo create a custom KPI, contact Capillary's support team.\nTo view the KPIs, perform the following:\nOn the Insights+ homepage, expand the\nLibrary\ndropdown.\nFrom the dropdown, select\nKPI\n.\nClick\nMy Org KPIs\nto view KPIs created by your org, along with the KPIs used within your org.\nClick\nAll KPIs\nto view KPIs available across all orgs.\nClick on any KPI of your choice to view additional information such as KPI name, description, and KPI settings regarding the KPI.\nDimension\nDimensions are descriptive attributes or categories that provide context to data. They are often used to filter data for better understanding and analysis. To see the full list of dimension tables available in Insights+ and their descriptions, refer to the\nDimension Tables documentation\n.\nFor instance, consider an organization with ‘Monthly Sales Revenue’ as its KPI and  “Product Categories” and “Geographical Location” as its defined dimensions.\nBy using these dimensions, the organization can extract meaningful insights.

The library encompasses all charts that are activated for the organization, comprising standard charts that come pre-configured and custom charts crafted by your organization's EI users.\nTypes of Charts\nNormal Chart\nA\nNormal chart\nis a preconfigured chart having combination of specific KPIs and dimensions. It helps simplifying analysis by presenting relevant metrics in a predefined format.\nMigration Chart\nA\nMigration chart\nis a particular type of chart that helps track the migration of users from one slab or segment to another slab or segment.\nFunnel Chart\nA\nFunnel chart\nhelps visualize a linear process that has sequential connected stages. In Insights+, the funnel chart translates a sequence of steps customers go through to complete an objective(purchase).\nFor example, for an email campaign funnel, a customer goes through these  stages:\nlink clicked > product page viewed > product clicked > product viewed > added to cart > cart viewed > purchase completed > points issued\n. The following image shows the different goals of email campaign tracking.\nUse case of funnel chart:\nOverlap Chart\nAn Overlap chart is a custom chart that is generated at the backend and cannot be manually created. An Overlap Chart is particularly useful when visualizing shared patterns in data. For instance, consider Customer 1 who purchases items A and B, and another customer who buys items B and C. An Overlap Chart assists in illustrating the commonality between these customers by plotting the overlapping purchase data. This visualization method is valuable for understanding and highlighting shared elements or trends among different sets of data, providing insights into patterns and intersections within diverse datasets.\nTo incorporate this chart into your report, initiate contact with your organization's sustenance team.\nThe chart is available for viewing in the\nReport\nsection.\nLedger Chart\nLedger charts are charts similar to bank statements, that include an opening balance, credits, debits, and a closing balance. In the context of a points ledger (liability report), the opening balance represents active points at the report's start, credits denote issued points, debits cover expirations and redemptions, and the closing balance reflects active points at the report's end date.\nAs the ledger chart is a custom chart it is generated at the backend and cannot be created manually.\nTo incorporate this chart into your report, contact your organization's sustenance team.\nThe chart is available for viewing in the\nReport\nsection.\nUpdated\nabout 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nTypes of Charts\nNormal Chart\nMigration Chart\nFunnel Chart\nOverlap Chart\nLedger Chart"

You can have a maximum of 20 KPIs per chart.\nThe KPIs are categorized into two sections,\nMy Org KPIs\nand\nAll KPIs\n.\n-\nMy Org KPIs\nare those KPIs created by your org, along with KPIs that are currently used within your org.\n-\nAll KPIs\nare those KPIs that are global. The user can toggle between the two tabs to select the KPI.\nYou can view\nMy Org KPIs\nby default.\nDimensions\nSelect the dimensions that you want to apply to the chart. You will see dimensions corresponding to the selected KPIs only.\nShow advanced chart options / Hide advanced chart options\nClick to see the advanced options mentioned in the rows below. You can also hide it by clicking the\nHide advanced chart option\n.\nInclusion Factors\nAllows you to add additional filters. These are based on the corresponding KPIs.\nNOTE:\nIf\nCustomer status\nis enabled for your org, make sure that you select all filters of\nEvent Users\nand select the relevant filters under\nCustomer status\n.\nShow selected KPIs w.r.t the following time periods\nIf you want to create charts with different time periods (multi-KPI charts) then use this option. This lets you view data for selected time dimensions.\nFor example, if you select a KPI Loyalty ABS and select Till date period, YTD, and MTD, you will see columns Loyalty ABS (YTD), Loyalty ABS (MTD) in the chart.\nNote\n: You can have a maximum of 20 KPIs - either only KPIs or the combination of KPIs and time period dimensions.\nTill date period\n: Lets you select a week to date (WTD), Month to date (MTD), year to date (YTD), Inception to date (ITD) - from the starting until the current data.\nLast time period\n: Lets you define the last `x' days, weeks, or months.\n*\nReport time period (RTP)\n: To consider the time period of the report where the chart is used\nCompare with\nChoose Previous Period to show the data compared with a previous duration. For instance, the current month's data with the previous month's\nChoose Previous Year to compare data with the same duration of the previous year. For example, data of May 1, 2019 - May 20, 2019, with May 1, 2018 - May 20, 2018.\n🚧\nWARNING\nIf customer status is enabled for your organisation,\nmake sure that you select all filters of\nEvent Users\nand select the relevant filters under\nCustomer status\n. Else a warning will appear to use the Customer Status instead of Event user.\nby default, customers with Deleted/Internal/Fraud confirmed are excluded from the report\nClick\nApply\nto preview the chart. If you want to modify input fields, click\nModify\nand make the necessary changes.\nIn\nEnter name for the chart\n, specify a name for the chart.\nClick\nCreate\n.\nYou can change the chart view to\nPie Chart, Table, or Bar graph\n.  To change the chart view, click on the ellipsis and select the required chart type.\nIf you want to rearrange the data trends and patterns in the chart, go to the\nTable Options\nand perform the following:\nDrag and drop the parameters in the\nRows\nand\nColumns\nbox. This provides an improved analysis of the selected KPIs and dimensions. For example, in the below image, on adding Reward type from row to column, the reward type is changed from row to column providing details associated with it.\nDrag the KPIs up or down to\nPrioritise\nthem.\nClick\nApply\n.\nExample - Creating a Badges Earned Chart\nConsider a scenario where a brand wants to generate reports for the badges earned by their customers. To achieve this, we can create a chart using \"Badges Earned\" as the KPI, alongside several dimensions like customer tier/slab, latest transaction date (latest updated date), total transaction value, and the customer's loyalty type.\nFollow the given steps to create the \"Badges Earned\" chart:\nOn the Insights+ home page, click\nLibrary\n>\nCharts\nfrom the left navigation panel.\nClick\nCreate Chart\n.\nKeep the\nChart Type\nas\nNormal\n. Click the\nKPI\ndropdown to expand the list of KPIs. Select the\nBadges Earned\nKPI from the list or type badges in the search box to locate the KPI. Click\nSelect\n.\nClick the\nDimension\ndropdown to expand the list of dimensions. Select the following dimensions -\nSlab Name; Total Sales and Loyalty Type\n(under\nCustomers\n); and Date (under\nLatest Updated Date\n). Click\nSelect\n.\nClick\nApply\n. This will populate the chart values and shown in the preview.\nName the chart and click\nCreate\n. The chart with the specified KPIs and dimensions is created and is now available in the chart list. Click on the chart to view or edit it. This chart can be incorporated into a report for deeper analysis and reporting.\nChart Analysis\nThe chart shows the distribution of badges earned by customers across different loyalty slabs and dates. The majority of badges (43%) were earned by customers in the 0-1000 loyalty slab on 2024-08-04. Another significant portion (29%) was earned by customers in the same loyalty slab on 2024-08-05. Higher loyalty slabs, such as Gold and Platinum, accounted for fewer badges earned, with 14% badges earned on 2024-08-13 and 2024-08-28, respectively.\nKey Insights\nLower Loyalty Slab Engagement: Customers in the 0-1000 loyalty slab are more active in earning badges, indicating higher engagement or possibly a larger customer base in this segment.\nLower Badge Activity in Higher Tiers: The Gold and Platinum tiers show lower badge earning activity, which could imply fewer customers or less engagement in these segments.\nThis chart helps identify which customer segments are most active and where there might be opportunities to boost engagement, especially in the higher loyalty tiers.\nMigration Chart\nTo create a migration chart:\nFrom the left panel, click\nLibrary\n>\nCharts\n.\nClick\nCreate Chart\n.\nExpand the\nChart Type\ndrop-down box and select\nMigration\nchart.\nExpand the\nSegment\ndrop-down box and select\nslab_name\n.\nChoose the desired visualization type based on the description provided in the following:\nMultiple migrations\n: Customer Migrations across all the partitions of a segment. Use this to track the movement of customers activity in different partitions of a segment.\nSingle migration grouped by time period\n: Let you track the migration from one partition to another partition of a segment in the specified period. You need to set the change of from partition and to partition along with the period.\nOption\nDescription\nFrom\nChoose the migration in the\nFrom\npartition and\nTo\npartition based on the chosen segment\nTo\nChoose the migration in the\nFrom\npartition and\nTo\npartition based on the chosen segment\nTime Period\nChoose the desired frequency of data split - either\nMonthly or Quarterly\nClick\nApply\n.\nIn\nEnter name for the chart\n, specify a name for the chart.\nClick\nCreate\n.\nFunnel Chart\nTo create a funnel chart:\nNavigate to\nLibrary\n>\nCharts\n>\nFunnel\nand click\nCreate Chart\n.\nExpand the\nChart Type\ndrop-down box and select\nFunnel\nchart.\nIn the\nFunnel Completion Time\n, enter the duration (in the number of days, weeks, or months) to complete all stages.\nFunnel completion time\nis the total duration that a user takes to complete the sequence of steps/stages to achieve a qualified goal.\nClick\nAdd Step\n. Expand the event name drop-down list and select the event.\nClick\nAdd Filter\n, and\nInclude or Exclude\nthe filter values (dimensions) as required.\n📘\nNote\nFilter values that are relevant to the selected event automatically populate in the drop-down list. You can add multiple filters to a step.\nClick\nApply\n. You will see the chart preview.\nEnter the\nchart name\n.\nClick\nCreate\n.\nExample - Promotion Funnel Drop-off Detection\nScenario\n: Identify customers left from any page (stage/step) during the product promotion process. It could be due to poor experience, a slow site, unexpected costs, or other factors that influence the objective (points allocation) during an email promotion.\nSolution\n: Here, the funnel chart helps visualize points allocation conversion steps through different transition levels. You can focus on the events - Added to cart and Check out, where many audiences are not moving towards the goal.\nExample\n: Consider you have selected report duration from 1 March to 30 September and a funnel completion time of 10 days.\nTable below gives the case scenarios where report duration is from\n1 March\nto\n30 September\nand a funnel completion time of\n10 days\n.\nCase Scenario\nCustomer’s funnel start date (first step)\nCustomer’s funnel end date (last step)\nAvailability of funnel steps during analysis (report creation)\n1\n5 March\n14 March\nInclude the customer with all the steps (as all the steps are completed in the funnel completion time of 10 days, within the report duration).\n2\n22 September\n1 October\nInclude the steps from 22nd September to 30th September performed by the customer (only till 30th September as 1st October exceeds the report duration).\n3\n10 August\n30 August\nInclude the steps from 10th August to 19th August performed by the customer (as funnel completion time is 10 days).\n4\n10 August\nNot ended\nInclude the steps from 10th August to 19th August performed by the customer.\n📘\nNote\nThe first step should start within the report duration to be a part of the funnel chart analysis.\nHence, you can track the sum of the actions of all the customers who enter the funnel by performing Step 1, from\n1 March\nto\n30 September\n, and exit it within 10 days by calculating; The number of converted customers between each step and the customer conversion rate between each step.\nTable below gives the detailed data of the funnel chart presentation.\nEvents\nNumber of Customers\nCustomer Attrition Rate (%)\nProduct viewed\n55\n0%\nProduct viewed > Added to cart\n39\n29%\nAdded to cart > Check out event\n13\n66%\nCheck out event > Product review\n0\n100%\nOverlap and Ledger Chart\nTo create an Overlap or Ledger chart, kindly contact the sustenance team.\nUpdated\n7 months ago\nTable of Contents\nNormal Chart\nExample - Creating a Badges Earned Chart\nMigration Chart\nFunnel Chart\nExample - Promotion Funnel Drop-off Detection\nOverlap and Ledger Chart"

Select the appropriate\nCategory\n. Select the report\nType\nas\nNormal\n.\nClick\nNext\n.\nClick\n+Add/remove charts\n.\nType the chart name or scroll through the chart list to locate the desired chart.

Click\nSave report\n.\nKey Insights from the Badges Earned Report\nMajority Engagement from Lower Tiers\nCustomers in lower sales ranges, especially the Base tier, account for nearly 80% of all badge earnings, indicating strong engagement at the lower end of the loyalty spectrum.\nPeak Engagement Period\nJune 2024 has a high number of badges earned, suggesting successful campaigns or promotions during this time, particularly among Base and Silver customers.\nLow Engagement in Premium Tiers\nHigher-tier customers, such as those in Gold and Platinum, contribute significantly fewer badges, indicating a need for strategies to increase engagement.\nOpportunities for Re-engagement\nBadge earnings are minimal in certain tiers, contributing only 1% or less, signalling an opportunity to re-engage these customers with targeted efforts.\nThese insights suggest focusing on maintaining base tier engagement while improving badge earning in higher tiers.\nUpdated\n7 months ago\nTable of Contents\nNormal, Migration and Funnel Report\nExternal Report\nPublish report\nExample Scenario: Analysing Badge Earnings\nKey Insights from the Badges Earned Report"

Audience is a group of customers, filtered on the basis of demographics, campaigns, transactions, and other activities. The audience filter can be applied to both standard and custom reports. Up to 3 audience group data can be simultaneously compared using Insights+. By leveraging audience analysis, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and engagement patterns.\nIn Insights+, audience groups can be compared, but their creation has to be done in Engage+. For more information on creating audience groups, click\nhere\n.\n📘\nNote\nBefore comparing audience groups in Insights+, ensure they are created in Engage+ first.\nApplications of audience group filter in reports\nThe audience group filter in reports serves several purposes:\nRefine a report to display specific audience-related information.\nAnalyze customer behavior to improve sales and enhance brand value.\nUtilize various audience group filters powered by Capillary's AI stack (AIRA) to forecast customer activities.\nDetermine target audiences based on their preferences for timing, products, and store locations.\nGenerate effective offers based on audience activity towards a specific brand or product.\n📘\nNote\nAll audience groups, including uploaded, combined, and filter-based groups, can be used as filters in reporting.\nApplying an audience group filter in a report\nTo apply an audience group filter in a report, perform these steps.\nOn the Insights+ page, navigate to the desired report.\nOpen the report and click\nAdd audience group\nto see the list of audience groups.\nIn the\nAudience Group\nlist, search and select the audience group by name.\n📘\nNote\nIn a report, you can apply up to three audience group filters.\nClick on the\nAudience group name\nto see a brief description of the audience group.\nClick\nDone\nto apply changes. The applied audience groups are displayed at the top of the report.\n📘\nNote\nTo create audience filters using the data from extended fields, please contact the Insights Sustenance and Data Science team.\nUse cases\nThe following are the use cases that help you understand the feature.\nScenario 1\nConsider a scenario where an organization wants to compare the purchasing patterns (based on products purchased) year-over-year (YoY) of a high-value customer group. This like-for-like (LFL) analysis can be accomplished using audience group filters.\nPerform the following:\nFrom the Insights+ page, open the sales report of interest.\nSelect an audience group filter from the compare audience list that has the Transaction date and time filter applied to it.\nNow, you can see the product performance (based on product category) for an audience group (audience_demo) between a specific time duration (e.g. for January 2023 and January 2024).\nIf you do not have the audience group in the list, you can create an audience group filter from Engage+ with the\nTransaction date and time\n.\nScenario 2\nConsider a use case where an organization wants to re-target an audience list with a minimum spend offer.\nTo decide the appropriate minimum spend threshold for the offer, perform the following:\nFrom the Insights+ page, open or create a report with an average transaction value-based banding of customers.\nSelect the audience list to see the distribution of customers with various bands to decide the minimum spend.\nNow, you can see the shopping done by customers during a campaign (New Year Campaign) with value-based banding (<5000, 5000-7000, 7000-9000, and 9000).\nIf you do not have the audience group in the list, you can create an audience group filter from Engage+.\n📘\nNote\nThe audience list keeps refreshing (in case of recurring campaigns), and while generating the reports, the audience version available nearest to the report end date is considered. In case, the report end date is prior to the date of audience creation, the report will use the first available instance of the audience. This can be used to perform pre-campaign analysis of the audience.\nFor example, if a campaign began on June 1st, 2024 and the audience was created on June 2nd, 2024, you can also get reports for the reporting period before June 2nd, 2024 (i.e., May 1st, 2024 to May 31st, 2024). In this case, the report would use the first available instance of the audience i.e., of June 2nd, 2024.\nUpdated\nabout 2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nApplications of audience group filter in reports\nApplying an audience group filter in a report\nUse cases\nScenario 1\nScenario 2"

For example, you can filter down the chart data, split data using dimensions, change visualization, and more. This article covers all the options available in the Chart Explore mode.\nTo open the chart explorer, navigate to the chart that you wish to explore and click the explore icon.\nReordering KPIs and Attributes\nYou may need to arrange the columns of your report in a specific order for better insight. The columns that have a higher priority must appear first so that readability of the report is enhanced and vital data appears as a heads-up.\nAdvanced options in the chart explorer, help you drill down your data with features like pivot table, data representation, display percentage of total, KPI filters, and KPI time period.\nTo reorder KPIs or attributes, follow the steps.\nClick\nShow advanced chart options\nand select the required feature (Pivot table or Display % of total or KPI filters or KPI time period).\nClick and hold the required KPI/attribute chip in the stackable list.\nDrag the KPI/attribute chip up or down to change the order.\nNote that the chart views are temporary, meaning they are reset when you refresh the page or navigate back to other reports. However, you can still access the details of the chart, and if needed, download the view in Excel format. If you want to permanently include the chart view in a custom report, you will need to open the report, edit it accordingly, and then save the changes.\nSee the following sections for detailed information on each advanced option.\nUsing Pivot table\nThis feature lets you visualize the data in a table. A table representation is the default view of a report that helps you to clearly analyse your data. You can also swap between rows and columns in order to draw attention to useful information. Pivot table leads to finding information quickly making it vital to data analysis.\nFor example, if your rows are dates and columns are KPIs, you can swap rows and columns to make rows as KPIs and columns as dates.\nTo swap rows and columns in the table, on the Pivot table, drag the chip in row to column or vice-versa, and click\nApply\n.\nThe process of using the Pivot table is shown below.\nMulti-level Sorting (Data Representation)\nIn Data Representation, you can do a multi-level sorting on the KPI values and attributes in ascending or descending order. When you sort the values of a KPI, you can be aware of the boundary conditions of your data. You can thus view minimum and maximum values, as well as any intermediate values.\nMulti-level sorting implies that you can apply sorting on multiple attributes and KPIs present in your report. However, the first KPI/attribute added is given the preference. The first KPI/attribute is titled\nSort by\nand the subsequent KPIs/attributes are titled\nThen by\n.\nTo sort chart KPIs/attributes in ascending or descending order, use the following steps.\nNavigate to the\nData representation\nicon,\nChange the priorities for multiple KPIs/attributes by dragging the chips up or down.\nExpand the KPI chip drop-down and choose 0 to 9 to sort the KPI values in the ascending order. Choose 9 to 0 to sort in descending order.\nTo add more KPIs and attributes to the sorting order, follow these steps.\nClick\n+/- KPIs/attributes\nto sort and check the KPIs that you want to include.\nClick\nAdd\nto apply the sorting options.\nTo clear all the applied sorting options, click\nReset\n.\nTo cancel without saving sorting options, click\nCancel\n.\nViewing KPI values in percentage (Display % of Total)\nYou can view KPI values in percentage to analyse the performance of a KPI and its contribution to the total value. This helps in to decide if any KPI has an overbearing effect on the total value and take measures.\nTo view KPI values in percentage of the total, perform the given steps.\nClick\nDisplay % of total\nicon.\nDrag and drop the Display % of total chip for your preferred KPI. The chart loads and displays the data for display percentage of total feature.\nTo apply a display as percentage of total chip to all KPIs available, enable Display % of total for all KPIs and drag and drop the Display % of total chip on any of the KPI.\nThe chart will reload and show the data of display percentage of the total for all additive KPIs.\nFor a KPI with Display % of total chip applied, an indication appears on the KPI chip as shown below.\nTo remove Display % of total option on a KPI chip, click X.\n📘\nDisplay percentage of total option can be applied on additive KPIs only.\nAdditive KPIs are the KPIs that can be aggregated through all of the dimensions (cumulative). For example, total sales, total registrations, lapsed customers, etc.\nApplying KPI Filters\nYou can filter chart data KPIs and analyse the results.\nThe KPI filters are helpful when you are dealing with large amounts of data and need to narrow down to very specific data points.\nTo filter data by KPIs, perform the given steps.\nClick the\nKPI filters\nicon.\nDrag and drop your preferred attribute value to the KPI. You can also search for a filter by typing its name in the search box and applying it by drag-drop.\nTo apply a KPI filter to all KPIs available, enable Apply value filters to all KPIs and drag and drop the preferred attribute value on any of the KPI.\nThe chart will reload and show the data of the applied filter for all KPIs.\nOnce you apply a filter to a KPI, you can view it on the KPI chip, as demonstrated below.\nTo remove a value filter on a KPI chip, click X.\nViewing KPI Time Period\nYou can use KPI time period to view or analyse KPI values for different time periods.\nReport time period (RTP)\n: It is the time period that is selected for the report. This is the default date-range applied to the chart. You can click on the calendar icon and modify the RTP. For more details on how to use date filters, click\nhere\n.\nYou can also apply other time periods if you want to see the data for different time periods in the same chart. It shows all the supported options in the KPI time period widget.\nTo analyze the data for different time periods, perform the given steps.\nIn\nShow advanced chart options\n, navigate to the KPI time period. You will see the list of time periods that can be applied to any KPI.\nTill date period: Lets you select week to date (WTD), month to date (MTD), quarter to date (QTD), year to date (YTD), Inception to date (ITD).\nLast time period: Shows the data of a KPI for the last `x' days, weeks, months, or quarters. You need to specify the number of days, weeks, months, or quarters in the\nLast time period\nbox.\nTime period relative to RTP: Define custom time period relative to RTP as explained.\nClick\n+Add time period\nEnter relevant\nDays/Weeks/Months/Quarters\nin\nDuration of.\nEnter relevant\nDays/Weeks/Months/Quarters\nin with a gap of.\nChoose a time period relative to the\nReport start date\nor\nReport end date\n.\nClick\nAdd\nto add the time period.\nDrag and drop a time period filter on your preferred KPI. The chart loads and displays the data for the new time period in a separate column.\nTo apply a time period filter to all KPIs available, enable\nSelect time period for all KPIs\nand drag and drop the desired time period filter on any of the KPI.\nThe chart will reload and show the data of the selected time period filter for each KPI in a separate column.\nFor a KPI with a time period applied, an indication appears on the KPI chip as shown.\nTo remove the added date filter, click X next to the filter.\n📘\nYou cannot remove the default report time period (RTP). However, if there is another date-filter applied to the KPI, the RTP can be removed.\nTo exit the Explore Mode, click the\nExplore mode\nheading on the page. A pop-up message appears, asking for confirmation to exit the explore mode. Click\nYes\nto go to the report page.\nUpdated\n4 months ago\nTable of Contents\nReordering KPIs and Attributes\nUsing Pivot table\nMulti-level Sorting (Data Representation)\nViewing KPI values in percentage (Display % of Total)\nApplying KPI Filters\nViewing KPI Time Period"

Dimensions can be applied to a KPI but cannot exist independently. Applying various dimensions to charts aids in understanding business data, such as sales data categorized by date, zone, month, year, etc., enabling deeper insights and analysis.\nFor example, if you are interested in analyzing the number of transactions at each store, you can set \"Transactions\" as the Key Performance Indicator (KPI), representing the metric you want to measure. The dimension would be \"Store-wise data,\" indicating that you want to categorize the transaction data based on different stores.\nSimilarly, in the second scenario, if you are examining sales data, you can set \"Sales\" as the KPI, representing the metric you are analyzing. The dimension would be \"Product-wise data,\" indicating that you want to categorize the sales data based on different products.\nThere are two types of dimensions:\nPrimary Dimensions - These are the dimensions selected by default while creating the report.\nSecondary Dimensions - These are the additional supported dimension attributes you can add to a chart.\nYou can apply dimensions for chart cards.\nAdd Dimensions/ Attributes to a Chart\nYou can replace primary dimensions with the same type of attribute values by expanding the drop-down box and selecting the values.\nTo change the attribute of an applied dimension\n: Open the report and scroll down to the chart card for which you want to apply dimensions. Expand the attribute drop-down and select the required attribute.\nTo add more dimensions, Click\n+/- attribute\n.\nFor example, to see a month-wise report of the current year, click\nDate\nto expand and select\nMonth\n.\nFollowing is the tabular format (for better understanding) of the zone-wise, month-wise reports.\nYou can see all applied dimensions below the chart header.\nRemove a dimension attribute\n: Click X to remove the respective attribute.\nNote\n: Dimensions are applied at the chart-card level and cannot be applied to the entire report.\nUpdated\n10 months ago\nTable of Contents\nAdd Dimensions/ Attributes to a Chart"

You can see some predefined periods such as WTD (start of the week until the current date), MTD (start of the month until the current date), QTD (start of the quarter until the current date), YTD (start of the year until the current date) by default. To get data from any other date range, use Custom.\nYou can then compare the data of a chosen duration with that of a previous to get better insights into the business performance. For example, you can compare sales of the current month with that of the previous month or with the same month of the previous year.\nTo filter a report data by date range:\nOn the top-right of the report, click on the date-range drop-down\na.\nTill Date\n: This lets you view the data for the current week, month, or year based on the chosen option\nWTD\n(Week-to-date): Data from the beginning of the week until the current date.

There are over 200 predefined filters grouped into various categories.\n📘\nFilters are at report level and affect all the KPIs of the report.\nTo apply filters to the report, do the following:\nOpen the report to which you want to apply filters and click the Filter icon.\nYou will see various categories of filters and not all the categories are shown upfront. A category contains attributes, and an attribute contains values.\nIn the\nSearch\nbox, type the filter category or attribute name. You will see the results as you type as shown below.\nClick on the desired attribute. You will see the values of that attribute as shown below.\nSelect one or more values that you want to apply to the current report and click\nInclude\n.\nYou can also exclude a specific attribute value in a report by choosing Exclude in the drop-down and selecting the values that you want to exclude. For example, I do not want to see the sales of fraud customers in a report\n📘\nYou cannot use both Include and Exclude simultaneously in an attribute.\nIf an attribute has too many values, you will not see any value by default. You need to use the\nSearch\nbox to fetch values.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago"

There are multiple filter options in Audience Group - loyalty information, transactions, campaign and coupon, user profile, and more. You can also create an audience group filter and apply it to the report.\nTo know more about how to create and use an audience group, refer\naudience group creation in Engage+.\n📘\nTo start with this filter, you need to know the basic usage of Insights+ reports and audience group filters. You also need to create an audience group filter in Engage+; it is only available in the\nCompare Audience\nlist in Insights+.\nApplications of Audience Group Filter in Report\nThe following are the applications of the audience group filter in a report.\nFilter a report with specific audience-related information. All audience groups, including uploaded, combined, and filter-based groups, can be used as filters in reporting.\nGenerate a report with customers’ behavior to enhance sales and brand value.\nPredict customers’ activities by implementing different audience group filters that use the AI stack of Capillary (AIRA).\nDecide the target audience based on their time, product, and store selection.\nGenerate effective offers based on audience activity towards a specific brand or product.\nApplying an Audience Group Filter in a Report\nTo apply an audience group filter in a report, follow these steps.\nOn the EI navigation pane, click\nAll Reports\n.\nIn\nAll Reports\n, search and select the report by name or filter the report list by\nAll Reports\n,\nFavorite Reports\n,\nCreated by Me\n, or\nStandard Reports\n. You can also create and select a custom report.\nIn the\nReport\n, click\nCompare Audiences\nto see the list of audience groups.\nIn the Audience Group list, search and select the audience group by name.\n📘\nIn a report, you can apply up to three audience groups filter.\nTo review the applied filters, click on the\nAudience group name\n. To see a brief description of each audience group list, hover on the\ninfo icon\n(besides the audience group name).\n📘\nTo see the latest data of an audience group, open the audience group, and click the Update Now link.\nClick\nDone\nto apply changes.\n📘\nTo create audience filters using the data from extended fields, please contact the Insights Sustenance and Data Science team.\nUse Cases\nThe following are the use cases that help you understand the feature.\nScenario 1\n: Consider a scenario where an organization wants to compare the purchasing patterns (based on products purchased) year-over-year(YoY) of a high-value customer group.\nSolution\n: This like-for-like(LFL) analysis can be accomplished using audience group filters. Open a sales report and select an audience group filter from the compare audience list that has the Transaction date and time filter applied to it. Now, you can see the product performance(based on product category) for an audience group(audience_demo) between a specific time duration(October 2019 and October 2020).\nIf you do not have the audience group in the list, you can create an audience group filter from Engage+ with the\nTransaction date and time\n.\nScenario 2\n: Consider a use case where an organization wants to re-target an audience list with a minimum spend offer.\nSolution\n: To decide the appropriate minimum spend threshold for the offer, open or create a report with an average transaction value-based banding of customers. Select the audience list to see the distribution of customers with various bands to decide the minimum spend. Now, you can see the shopping done by customers during a campaign(New Year Campaign) with value-based banding (<5000, 5000-7000, 7000-9000, and 9000).\nIf you don’t have the audience group in the list, you can create an audience group filter from Engage+.\nUpdated\nabout 2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nApplications of Audience Group Filter in Report\nApplying an Audience Group Filter in a Report\nUse Cases"

A\ndimension table\nholds descriptive attributes related to facts, such as customer information, product details, or time periods, which help categorize and filter the data.\nIn reporting, fact tables provide the numeric data to be analysed, while dimension tables allow users to dig deep and filter this data for specific insights.\nFacts and dimensions, are structured in a\nSTAR Schema Layout\nwithin our data storage system. In a star schema layout, fact tables are stored at the centre, containing the quantitative data, while dimension tables are stored around the fact table, connected by foreign or linking keys, providing descriptive context to the data. This structure optimizes queries and facilitates efficient data analysis and reporting.\nExamples of fact and dimension tables\nConsider the badges fact and dimension tables:\nFor Badges, there are 3 fact tables linked to 7 dimension tables.\nBadges Fact Tables are:\nBadges Earn\nBadges Issued and\nBadges Earned Benefits\nE.g.

When any award happens entries go to PA tables. When any deductions(expiry, redemption, return) happens entries go to the PD table and we update the PA tables. PD tables entries will reference PA tables. Lets understand this with an example:\nAward 100 points on 2 lineItems. Entries will go to points_awarded_lineitems table. There are other columns but we are ignoring those columns for now.\nid\norg_id\nprogram_id\npoints_value\nredeemed_value\nreturned_value\nexpired_value\nexpiry_date\nline_item_id\nevent_log_id\nPAL1\n100\n101\n40.000\n0\n0\n0\nL1\nPAL2\n100\n101\n60.000\n0\n0\n0\nL2\nAny deduction will make an entry in the PD table. Let’s assume we do a redemption for 30 points and those 50 points and those 50 points come from PAL1(40 points) and PAL2(10 points). So the table will look like this.\ndeduction_summary_id -> warehouse.points_redemption_summary (this value can be -1 in case of expiry and returns)\nid\norg_id\nprogram_id\npoints_deducted\ndeduction_type\ndeduction_summary_id\nPA_ref_id\nPA_ref_type\ndeducted_on\nevent_log_id\nPD1\n100\n101\n40.000\nREDEEMED\nPRS1\nPA1\nPAL\nPD2\n100\n101\n10.000\nREDEEMED\nPRS1\nPA2\nPAL\nid\norg_id\nprogram_id\npoints_value\nredeemed_value\nreturned_value\nexpired_value\nexpiry_date\nline_item_id\nevent_log_id\nPAL1\n100\n101\n40.000\n40.000\n0\n0\nL1\nPAL2\n100\n101\n60.000\n10.000\n0\n0\nL2\nNow PAL2 have 50 points remaining on it and expiry runs expiry will make one more entry in PD table\nid\norg_id\nprogram_id\npoints_deducted\ndeduction_type\ndeduction_summary_id\nPA_ref_id\nPA_ref_type\ndeducted_on\nevent_log_id\nPD1\n100\n101\n40.000\nREDEEMED\nPRS1\nPA1\nPAL\nPD2\n100\n101\n10.000\nREDEEMED\nPRS1\nPA2\nPAL\nPD3\n100\n101\n50.000\nEXPIRED\nPRS1\nPA2\nPAL\nid\norg_id\nprogram_id\npoints_value\nredeemed_value\nreturned_value\nexpired_value\nexpiry_date\nline_item_id\nevent_log_id\nPAL1\n100\n101\n40.000\n40.000\n0\n0\nL1\nPAL2\n100\n101\n60.000\n10.000\n0\n50.00\nL2\nDo note that the effective value of any PA entry never goes negative. Because we don’t deduct more points than what is available there.\nReturn After Redemption scenario:\nEffective Value on a PA entry = points_value - redeemed_value - expired_value - returned_value\nMove points when other PA entry has some available points\nWhen we redeem points, the effective value on any PA entry decreases. When we make a return we are decreasing the effective points in that case as well. In that scenario, effective value might go negative. In those scenarios we try to move redeemed_value from one PA entry to another PA entry. Moving redeemed value here means that we un-redeem from one PA entry and redeem from another PA entry.\nExample:\nFor simplicity, let’s assume that we are earning points on the bill (warehouse.points_awarded table).\n1. A customer makes first Transaction T1 and earns 100 points (balance is 100 points)\n2. Customer makes T2 and he gets 150 points (balance is 250 points)\nid\norg_id\nprogram_id\npoints_value\nredeemed_value\nreturned_value\nexpired_value\nexpiry_date\nbill_id\nevent_log_id\nPA1\n100\n101\n100.000\n0\n0\n0\nBILL-1\nPA2\n100\n101\n150.000\n0\n0\n0\nBILL-2\nCustomer redeems 110 points, let’s assume that PA1(100 points)  + PA2(10 points) are consumed, entries will look like this.

As you can see here, we have to move some points from PA1 to PA2. The reason is that PA1 is getting returned here fully. After return effective points become -100 on PA1. So to make effective points 0, we have to move redeemed_value from PA1 to some other place. As points are available on PA2, we move those points to PA2. We created PD4 and PD5 in this scenario. PD4 is a REDEEM_REVERTED entry. This entry is opposite to PD1. PD1 and PD4 suggest that PA1 effective redeemed_value is zero. PD3 is the RETURN deduction type and suggests that we have returned values as 100. PA1 effective values is ZERO as we have REDEEMED and REDEEM_REVERTED entry and one return entry for this. Balance is 140-100 = 40 points\nid(PA)\norg_id\nprogram_id\npoints_value\nredeemed_value\nreturned_value\nexpired_value\nexpiry_date\nbill_id\nevent_log_id\nPA1\n100\n101\n100.000\n0.00\n100.00\n0\nBILL-1\nPA2\n100\n101\n150.000\n110.00\n0\n0\nBILL-2\nid(PD)\norg_id\nprogram_id\npoints_deducted\ndeduction_type\ndeduction_summary_id\nPA_ref_id\nPA_ref_type\ndeducted_on\nevent_log_id\nPD1\n100\n101\n100.000\nREDEEMED\nPRS1\nPA1\nPA\nPD2\n100\n101\n10.000\nREDEEMED\nPRS1\nPA2\nPA\nPD3\n100\n101\n100.00\nRETURN\n-1\nPA1\nPA\nPD4\n100\n101\n100.00\nREDEEM_REVERTED\nPRS1\nPA1\nPA\nPD5\n100\n101\n100.00\nREDEEMED\nPRS1\nPA2\nPA\nPABP negative scenario because of return after redemption\nWe will continue with the same example, As we can see here PA1 is fully consumed after return. PA2 has 40 points available. Balance is 40 points. Now let’s assume the customer returns Bill-2 as well. So we will have to return 150 points from the customer balance. Balance becomes 40-150 = 110 points. This is clearly saying that the customer never earned points because he returned all the bills he made but he redeemed 110 points.\nPA2 effective points are becoming -110 here. This means that we have to move the redeemed points from PA2 entry as well. But we don’t have any other entry available where we can move these points. This is where the PABP negative entry will come into picture. We will un-redeem points from PA2. We will create an entry is points_awarded_bill_promotions (PABP) entry. It’s points value is 0 but there will be redeemed_value on this entry. This PABP entry’s effective value is negative, which we never allow to happen for the original entries in our system. But PABP negative entry is kind of exception and keep our tree balanced.

But what happens to this entry in the future. Now, As we have balance is -100. If the customer does not earn any points in the future. This remains the state. But if the customer earns more points. Customer’s balance will become positive.\nFor example if the customer earns 500 more points then balance becomes -110 + 500 = 390.

It’s quite possible points to expire are less than or equal to PABP negative entry redeemed value, in that case we make the adjustment but we don’t expire anything.\nIf points to expire are more, we adjust all PABP negative entries and remaining points are expired. There can be more than one PABP negative present for a customer.\nNote\n:\nThis adjustment can be done when the customer is earning points. For example we have our balance as -110. So at this moment we know that PABP negative entry is present for sure. If a customer earns some points at this moment, then we know that we can make adjustments. As of now in the code flow we are not doing it. We are making adjustments only at the time of points expiry. But that’s one more way to handle it, why to wait for points to expire to make the adjustments. This might change in future, we might start making PABP negative adjustments at the time of PA3 earning, when the customer’s balance was negative and customer balance increased by some value.\nImportant terms:\nPA - Points Awarded\nPAL - Points Awarded Line Items\nPALP-Points Awarded Line Item Promotion\nPABP -Points Awarded Bill Promotion\nPD -Points Deducted\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nAwarded and Deduction example entries\nReturn After Redemption scenario:\nMove points when other PA entry has some available points\nPABP negative scenario because of return after redemption\nPABP negative adjustment after PABP negative is created"

Segments are used to tailor the marketing efforts of brands effectively. Segmentation is usually done based on demographics or customer behavior. A segment consists of different values called partitions. For example, we can have a segment name Transaction Value whose partitions could be High, Medium, and Low.\nThe segments are used for effective targeting and reporting in modules such as Campaigns, Loyalty, and Essential Insights.\nTypes of Segments\nBased on whether the activities of customers are tracked, segments are again categorized into two types:\nSCD\n(Slowly Changing Dimension ): This is a type of segmentation in which the behavior of customers is tracked at a given point in time. Usually, SCD segments are used for migration charts\nNon-SCD\n: The behavior of customers is not tracked and only the current snapshot of the customer list is maintained. In non-SCD, the system stores only recently updated time and do not maintain the tracking history of previous updates. Examples of non-SCD based segments could be segmentation based on customer registration or gender\nDifferent Methods of Segment Creation\nThere are two ways of creating customer segments\nUpload customer list\n: One way of creating segments is by uploading the customer list with customer identifier and segment value (partition name). The segments created through upload are static. If you want to update an existing segment, you need to upload the new file manually. To create a segment through file upload, you can either upload a file directly or through an FTP server. For more information, see Creating segments through file upload\nUsing rules & conditions\n: Another way of creating segments is through predefined rules. You can define rules for each partition of a segment. For example, you can have a partition named HighLoyal with the condition of customers whose transaction value is greater than 10000. In rule-based, segments will be updated automatically based on the ruleset. For information on how to create rule-based segments, see Creating segments using rules\n📘\nNote\nThe system allows a maximum of 20 SCD segments and a total of 50 active segments. If you exceed this number, the system prompts you to deactivate an existing active segment in order to create a new segment.\nNavigating Segments\nTo access user segments, navigate to Insights+ >\nUser segments\n>\nStatus\n.\nFrom the\nStatus\ndrop-down list, you can choose to view\nAll\n,\nActive\n, or\nInactive\nuser segments, depending on which ones you want to access.\nTo locate a specific user segment, use:\nSearch Box\n- To search the user segment by name.\nType\nfilter - To filter the segments by its type - SCD or Non SCD.\nMethod\nfilter - To filter the segments by the method of creation - Conditions or Upload.\nSort\noption- To sort the segments alphabetically using the\nName\nor the\nLast modified date\n.\nThe following screenshot shows the appearance of a user segment after creation:\nDraft\n: This indicates that the recent changes made in the segment are not updated yet (The changes are just saved. You need to click on Update to reflect the changes). If you open the segment, you will see\nDraft\navailable\n:\nSave changes to see the partition values\n. You can save or Deactivate draft segments\nActive segment\n: Only active segments are available for other services that use Segments. You can either edit or deactivate active segments\nInactive segment\n: These segments will be inactive and will not appear in any service that consumes segments. You can edit and activate inactive segments\n📘\nNote\nIf no partitions are found for the segment you created, the system displays the following message:\n\"No partition found, please\nedit segment\nto add partition values.\"\nProceed to edit the segment to add the necessary partition values.\nUpdated\n6 months ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nTypes of Segments\nDifferent Methods of Segment Creation\nNavigating Segments"

However, you can edit a segment to update details manually, i.e., you can add new customers or update existing segment values  (partition name) of customers.\nYour CSV file should have the following headers:\n1st column header: user_id, mobile, email or external_id\n2nd column header: value\nYou can also track customer activities manually by making the respective segment SCD and specifying the date of the tracked values every time you update the segment.\nTo create a segment through file upload:\nOn the EI navigation pane, click\nUser Segments\n.\nClick\nCreate Segment\n.\nIn\nSegment Name\n, specify a name for the group.\nIn\nDescription\n, specify a short description of the segment.\nIn\nType\n, select\nSCD\nto keep a track of customer behavior for the current segment. Select\nNon-SCD\nto save only the current snapshot.\nIn\nMethod\n, choose Upload for list creation through file upload.\nClick\nNext\nto continue.\nOPTION\nDESCRIPTION\nValid from\nYou need to manually specify the date when the events specified in the CSV file have happened (for SCD). Hence, whenever you upload a new file, it is required to specify the date on which the values are tracked\nUpload Type - Upload\nSelect\nUpload\nto directly upload the CSV file and click Choose File to upload the fil\nSample contents of a .csv file with customer id and loyalty value: mobile,value44700900000,High 44700915020,Low\n44700911011,High\nUpload Type - FTP\nSelect\nFTP\nto upload through an FTP server >specify the path in the FTP server where the file is available and > click\nUpload\nNote:\nEnter a valid FTP path. FTP path must be relative to the configured root folder. For example, root\nfolder/FTP path such as ftp://demo_apac/demo_master/demo_path/demo**points.csv. Here, demo_apac/demo_master/ is the root folder and /demo_path/ is the FTP path.\nTo use FTP, you should have configured the FTP  address and access credentials as explained below\n1. Navigate to\nSegments\n>\nSettings\n.\n2. Specify\nServer Address\n(FTP server URL),\nUsername\n, and\nPassword\n.\nNotes:\n1. The file name should adhere to the following format: \"_segment name__suffix\n**\"\nFor instance, take 'demo__points.csv' as an example. Here, 'demo' represents the segment name, separated by a double underscore from the 'points' suffix.\n2. The FTP path must point to the correct CSV file.\n3. The first row of the CSV sheet must be a column header.\n4. The first column header must be a user identifier such as user id, mobile, email, and external_ID.\nIf the identifier is mobile(mobile number), country code is mandatory (without the \"+\" sign). For example, 919972752991.\n5. The second column header must have a partition value. For example, If the first column header is the user_id(1,2,3, and so on) then the second column header must hold the partition value( high, medium, or low).\nClick\nUpload & Proceed\n. You will see the segment with the list of partitions as shown below\nPartitions\n: Partitions are different values of a segment. For example, if a segment has high loyal, low loyal, and medium loyal as segment values, then three partitions will be created (one for each value)\nOnce the processing is completed, review the details and click\nCreate\nThe segment will be in Inprogress status initially and once processed, the status label will disappear automatically.\nInprogress: The segment creation is being processed\nDraft: Signifies draft state where the recent changes were not saved. If you open the segment, you will see Draft available: Save changes to see the partition values. You can save or Deactivate draft segments\nEditing an existing upload-based segment\nYou can modify a segment to add or modify existing details. During editing the upload-based segment, the existing segment details will be completely replaced with the new details that you upload. So, make sure you create a new file accordingly.\n📘\nNote\nEach time you upload or import a file using the upload-based segmentation, the data from the new file replaces the existing data.\nTo edit a segment\nOn the Segments summary page, click on the segment that you want to edit.  You can filter the summary list by Type (SCD, Non-SCD, or All) and Method (Conditions, Upload, or All) and also search for a specific filter in the\nSearch\nbox.\nClick\nEdit Segment\n.\nChoose your preferred\nUpload Type\nand upload the new file\nClick\nUpload & Proceed\n. Wait until the file is processed successfully\nClick\nUpdate\n.\nUpdated\n6 months ago\nTable of Contents\nTo create a segment through file upload:\nEditing an existing upload-based segment\nTo edit a segment"

You can create a new segment or select any segment that is manually refreshed through FTP upload. For these segments, you can configure an automated refresh cycle using scheduled upload features. For example, a segment created on Insights+ using analytics notebooks(Databricks) refreshes automatically every week - update the segment values to a CSV file by syncing it to the specific FTP path(folder). Insights+ automatically selects the latest file and refreshes the segment according to the selected frequency and validity.\nThere are two types of customer segments -\nSCD\nand\nNon-SCD\n. SCD based scheduled upload records segment snapshots at multiple points of time, whereas to perform upload on the latest segment snapshot Non-SCD based scheduled upload is used.\nSegment Status\nThe following are the segment status.\nInprogress\n: Segment creation is under process.\nDraft\n: Signifies a draft state where the recent changes are not saved. You can open the segment to save the draft available and click on Create to save the partition values. You can also edit partitions or Deactivate draft segments.\nActive\n: Only active segments are available for services that use Segments. You can either edit or deactivate an active segment.\nInactive\n: These segments will be inactive and not appear in any service that consumes segments. You can modify an inactive segment to activate it.\nCreate a new segment\nTo create a new segment with scheduled FTP server upload, follow the steps.\nOn the EI navigation pane, click\nSegments\n>\nUser Segments\n.\nClick the\nCreate Segment\n.\nIn the\nSegment Name\n, specify a name for the group.\nIn the\nDescription\n, specify a short description of the segment.\nIn\nType\n, select\nSCD\nto keep track of customer behavior for the current segment. Select\nNon-SCD\nto save only the current snapshot.\nIn the\nMethod\n, select\nUpload\nand click\nNext\nto continue.\nIn\nUpload Type\n, select\nScheduled Upload\n.\nIn\nScheduled Upload\n, select the\nFTP Configuration\nto configure the following options\nOptions\nDescription\nFTP name\nSelect the FTP name from the list. You can select from five FTP names as configured in FTP settings.\nFTP path\nEnter a valid FTP path. FTP path must be relative to the configured root folder. For example, root_folder/FTP path such as ftp://demo_apac/demo_master/demo_path/demo**points.csv. Here, demo_apac/demo_master/ is the root folder and /demo_path/ is the FTP path.\nNote:\n- Name of the file must be in the format 'name of the segment**any suffix'. For example, consider demo__points.csv as a file name here demo is the segment name separated by a double underscore from the suffix(points).\n- The FTP path must point to the correct CSV file.\n- The first row of the CSV sheet must be a column header.\n- First column header must be a user identifier such as user id, mobile, email, and external_ID.\n- If the identifier is mobile(mobile number), country code is mandatory (without the \"+\" sign). For example, 919972752991.\n- The second column header must have a partition value. For example, If the first column header is the user_id(1,2,3, and so on) then the second column header must hold the partition value( high, medium, or low).\nFrequency\nSchedule the FTP upload frequency by selecting the options - daily, weekly, or monthly. This schedule starts on the day the user segment is created and ends on the last day, week, or month as selected in the frequency and validity option. Since this update occurs after the ETL process, the underlying data may be up to 24 hours old.\nConsider the segment created using FTP scheduled upload on October 1, 2020.\nDaily\n: The schedule starts from October 1, 2020, till the last(to) date of validity.\nNote\n: Daily schedule always runs on the system sync time. It is recommended to use a daily schedule rather than a weekly and monthly schedule for a regular refresh in the upload of data.\nWeekly\n: The schedule starts from October 5, 2020, till the last(to) week of validity.\nNote\n: Weekly schedule always starts on Monday. If on Monday the schedule is created before the system sync time then the schedule starts on the same day.\nMonthly\n: The schedule starts from November 1, 2020, till the last(to) month of validity.\nNote\n: Monthly schedule always starts from the 1st day of every month. If the schedule is created before the system sync time then the schedule starts from October 1, 2020.\nValidity\nTo mention the validity of the scheduled upload's frequency, select the start(\nfrom\n) and end(\nto\n) date using a calendar picker.\nRecipient\nTo receive the error notifications, select the recipient(s) using the drop-down list. Any recipient who has access to the organization can receive the notification based on your selection from the drop-down list.\nClick\nSave\nand\nProceed\n. Once the process is complete, review the details and click\nCreate\n.\nAfter the segment creation using scheduled FTP upload, you can see the segment with a list of partitions as shown below.\n📘\nYou can see the segment partition once the segment is created depending on the start date of the scheduled FTP upload\nPartitions\n: Partitions are different values of a segment. For example, suppose a segment has High loyal, Medium loyal, and Low loyal as segment values. In that case, three partitions will be created (one for each value).\nEdit existing uploaded segment\nTo modify an existing upload-based segment using a scheduled FTP server upload, follow the steps.\nOn the EI navigation pane, click\nSegments\n>\nUser Segments\n.\nClick on the\nSegment Name\nthat you want to edit. You can filter the summary list by\nType (SCD)\nand\nMethod (Upload)\nand search for a specific filter in the\nSearch box\n.\nClick the\nEdit Segment\n.\nIn the\nEdit segment\n, click on\nEdit partitions\n.\nIn\nUpload Type\n, select\nScheduled Upload\n.\nIn\nScheduled Upload\n, configure upload options such as\nFTP\n,\nFTP path\n,\nFrequency\n,\nValidity\n, and\nRecipient\n.\n📘\nFor detailed information on configurable options, refer to step 8 under the heading Create a new segment.\nClick\nSave\nand\nProceed\n. Once the process is complete, review the details and click\nCreate\n.\nAfter updating the segment using scheduled FTP upload, you can see the segment with a list of partitions. You can also edit the partition.\n📘\nAfter updating the segment, initially, it will be in Inprogress status until the scheduled upload happens, post-process completion the status label disappears\nExecution logs\nTo track each scheduled upload status, you can check the execution logs that contain a list of details of successful and unsuccessful scheduled uploads.\nGreen Dot\n: Signifies successful execution\nRed Dot\n: Signifies failed execution.\nUpdated\nabout 1 month ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nSegment Status\nCreate a new segment\nEdit existing uploaded segment\nExecution logs"

The segment details are updated automatically based on the ruleset. Rule-based segments are usually SCD and activity-based.\nFor example, you can have a segment based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and have partitions as explained below:\nChampions:  High spending customers who purchased recently and also shop quite often\n(Last Txn Date in the last 10 days) AND (Latency < 25) AND (Lifetime Purchased > 500)\nLoyal Customers: A frequent shopper and responsive to promotions.\n(Last Txn Date in the last 30 days) AND (Latency between 25 and 45) AND (Lifetime Purchased between 200 and 500)\n📘\nNote\nEach org unit can create a maximum of 20 SCD segments. So if you want to create a new one thereafter, you need to deactivate an existing SCD segment and create a new one. If the brand requires more than 20 SCD segments, they can request additional segments by contacting the product sustenance team.\nThere is no limit on non-SCD segments.\nTo create a rule-based segment:\nOn the EI navigation pane, click\nUser Segments\n>\nCreate Segment\n.\nIn\nSegment Name\n, specify a name for the group.\nIn\nDescription\n, specify a short description of the segment.\nIn\nType\n, select\nSCD\nto keep a track of customers' behavior for the current segment.

You can export data related to customers, transactions, coupons, points, Footfall, and campaigns.\nYou can create an export job using templates that define. Each template is a combination of either KPIs or facts and dimensions.\nWhat are the key features of Data Export?\nCreate custom data templates\nSupport for Extended Fields, Footfall Data, and Profile V2\nGet data by recently updated date or event date\nExport Ids of stores, users, and products\nExport custom fields, and extended fields\nExport a specific audience list using KPIs and dimensions\nWorks on auto-update time of tables\nWhat are the limitations of Data Export?\nSupports a maximum of one year's data. The maximum size of the file which can be exported is 20GB. If the exported file exceeds this limit, a validation error is triggered.\nNote:\nThe export functionality operates exclusively on incremental data sets. An incremental data set refers to a subset of data that has been updated or modified since the last export or processing operation. Instead of exporting or processing the entire data set each time, only the changes or additions made since the last operation are considered. This approach helps in optimizing resource usage and improving efficiency, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.\nUnable to edit a template once created\nUnable to modify KPIs, dimensions, filters, and customer list once scheduled\nUnable to export measures (such as bill id, bill number, bill amount, auto-update time) and custom fields in custom templates. You can export only KPIs and its dimensions\nLimit of selecting only five dimensions in a custom template for an export job\nData of the current day will not be included in the exported data as the data will be synced to the capillary server only during nights\nWhere can I export data?\nYou can export data to an FTP server (for both internal and external).\nWhat are the supported scheduling frequencies?\nYou can schedule an export job to run on a daily, weekly, monthly basis; or on a fixed date. However, if you schedule an export job to receive weekly data every Monday, you will get the data on Tuesday as Monday's data will be synced at the end of the day. So, you will get data until Monday on Tuesday.\nHow does the export schedule work?\nAssume that you have scheduled an export to receive data from Apr 1 - Apr 15. You will get data on Apr 16 which contains the data available from Apr 1 until Apr 15.\nThe data of the current day will be synced to the Capillary system only after the ETL run. This sync usually happens in night. Hence, you will get the current day's data the next day.\nIn recurring export schedules, you always get data until the previous day. In one-time export schedule, you cannot select the current date or future date. So, you will get data for the selected duration.\nHow does the Rerun option work?\nRerun is used to export data manually when there is an exception in the export job.\nTo rerun a failed scheduled job, navigate to Export Schedule > Specific schedule details > Execution Log > Rerun.\nYou will not see Rerun for jobs that ran successfully.\nWhat is the difference between one-time and recurring export jobs?\nAn export job can be a recurring event or one-time activity. You can schedule a recurring to receive data on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. However, you can use one-time job if you want a specific data just once.\nWhat is Event Date?\nIt is the date when a specific event has occurred. For example, if a transaction has happened on Apr 7, but it synced to the system on Apr 9, the event date of that transaction is still 7th of Apr.\nWhat is Last Updated Date?\nThe date when a specific data are actually synced to the capillary system. Considering the example mentioned above, if a transaction has happened on Apr 7, but it was actually synced to the Capillary Database on Apr 9, the last updated date of that transaction is Apr 9.\nWhat is the difference between Event Date, and Last Updated Date or Modified Date?\nEvent date refers to the date on which an event has occurred. The event could be transaction when looking at transaction table, registration when looking at the registration table and so on. The last updated date or modified date for a particular record is, however, the recent date when any of the row values is updated in the system.\nIf a customer is registered on Jan 1, 2019, which is also the event date here. If that customer makes another transaction on May 5, 2019, the transaction table will be updated, for example, the columns lifetime purchases, transaction, loyalty points, lifetime points or any other column. Hence, the last updated date will be May 5, 2019.\nWhat type of data can be exported using Data Export?\nYou can export customers, transactions, coupons, points, Footfall, and campaigns data. You can customize the type of data and fields that you want to export using the combination of KPIs or facts, and dimensions.\nHow do I know the status of a data export job?\nWhen scheduling a data export job, you need to configure the recipients to send status notifications. These recipients will get all success notifications on every status update. However, you can check failure statuses only on the UI (export schedule details)\nWhat are filters and dimensions in an export template?\nFilters let you drill-down the data to a granular level whereas dimensions allow you to break up the data according to the chosen dimension values. For example, if you want to see transactions of a specific store, use filters; if you want to see store-level transactions of a zone, use dimensions.\nHow is a dimension filter different from audience filter?\nA dimension filter lets you drill down the data to a specific dimension value whereas an audience filter drills down the data to a particular customer list.\nCan I edit a template once created?\nYou cannot edit a template once created. However, you can modify the template to add or remove KPIs, facts, dimensions, and apply filters to get very specific data. These changes will remain within the schedule and do not modify the original template.\nCan I modify a scheduled job?\nYou can only modify the execute on, frequency and validity. For a one-time scheduler, you cannot even change the frequency.\nCan I duplicate an export job?\nYes, instead of creating again from scratch,  you can duplicate the export job that you want to reuse. Go to the export job that you want to reuse > Click Duplicate > Modify the data that you want to export as required > Click Create\nCan I delete or modify an FTP server after adding?\nOnce an FTP is added, you cannot delete or rename it. However, you can change server details and path within that FTP.\nHow can I export custom fields and extended fields in an export job?\nCustom fields and extended fields are not selected by default in a template. Also, you cannot have custom fields in custom templates.\nYou can select the custom fields corresponding to that specific template. For example, you cannot export customer level custom fields using the transaction template. There is no such limitation for extended fields. You can export customer level extended fields in the transaction template.\nWhy is there a sudden increase in the data size of my daily or weekly export schedule during the month end?\nUsually, the tier downgrade strategy or points expiry strategy runs at the month-end resulting in downgrade or renewal of tiers, and expiry of points wherever applicable. This will affect the change of the last updated date and event date of points and coupons. Hence, you might observe an increase in the data, especially, during month ends.\nWhy extended fields data are not available in exported data?\nIf an org is set only for an incremental run, even if you import extended fields of the last 4 years, EI will show data only up to two years. Hence, you might see missing extended fields data in reports.\nEven after importing, if extended fields data is not available for a transaction or customer, see whether you are able to see these details on Member Care.\nThere are two types of extended fields - vertical-specific and global level. When you send a request to the EI team for data sync, specify the vertical associated with the extended field.\nEnsure that the API team has done the proper mapping of extended fields\nUpdated\nabout 1 month ago"

In a recurring event, only fresh data is downloaded every time the scheduled job runs. For example, if a user has scheduled an export job to run for one month on a daily basis, only the previous day's data will be exported every day for one month.\nNote\n:\nThe system does not assure a fixed finish time for the jobs. The export framework picks up a job according to the order of scheduled time.\nConfiguring an export schedule involves the following steps:\nCreate an Export Job (Step 1 of 3)\nexport job]\nSelect Data Templates (Step 2 of 3)\ntemplates that you want to export]\nModifying Template & Creating Schedule (Step 3 of 3)\ntemplates to add or remove fields, apply filters and dimensions to export a specific data that you need\nClick\nCreate\nto schedule\n📘\nImportant\nWhen you use a Dimension template, the entire data will be exported irrespective of the duration filter applied. Hence, it is recommended not to use templates of Dimensions, Users for example, for recurring schedules unless you wanted to apply the Audience Group filter on it\nYou cannot apply standard filters such as outlier status, fraud status, merge status, and admin TILL\nOnce scheduled, the recipients will receive emails as per the scheduled frequency with the job details including the destination link of the exported data.\n📘\nNote\nAs the export job writes the files in the specified FTP location, It is recommended to periodically check whether the username/password of the FTP location is configured correctly.\nTo access files from the FTP location, user should have read access to the FTP location\nFetching Export Jobs\nOnce an export job is created, you can see the status of the job on the\nExport Schedules\npage. There are more options available to make your search easy.\nSearch a scheduled job\n: Use the search box to search for a specific export job\nFilter list by frequency\n: See jobs with only frequency Once, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. By default, you will see 'All' frequency jobs\nFilter list by status\n: See jobs with the current status - All, Active, or Completed. By default, All jobs are selected.\nActions\n: Click the more ... icon to Duplicate or Delete a job and View Execution log\nJob Execution Status\n: A job can have any of the following statuses - Yet to Execute, Success, In Progress\nA clock sign Indicates the job is created and is yet to execute (not even once)\nA yellow icon Indicates an execution is in progress currently. A recurring schedule job can have more than 1 executions where as a one-time schedule will have only one execution.\nA green icon Indicates the current execution is successfully executed. For example, if there is a weekly schedule, and the current weeks execution is completed successfully, it shows the green icon. However, when the next execution starts in the next week, it will change to yellow again\nA red icon for the status indicates that the job is unable to execute\n📘\nNote\nA recurring schedule job can have more than 1 executions where as a one-time schedule will have only one execution\nWhen the job is in progress, you cannot kill or rerun the job\nFor each successful export job, an email will be sent to all the chosen recipients with the destination links of the exported files  (either FTP or S3). To download files from FTP server, click the respective link received on the email, login and download the zip file\nTo view details of a specific job:\nClick on the\nschedule\nthat you want to see\nOn the\nOverview\ntab, you can see the details of the schedule such as schedule name, description, schedule type, FTP tag, frequency, execution date, export data fields, notify recipients, and templates.\nTo see the execution log, click the\nExecution\nLog tab.\nIf an export job fails in the middle for some reason, you can run the job manually by clicking the\nRerun\nbutton. The job will run from the previous successful schedule.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nFetching Export Jobs"

Standard templates are created from facts, and dimensions whereas a custom dimension is a combination of KPIs and dimensions.  Standard templates consist of raw data whereas custom templates can have summarized data. For example, Standard templates consist of columns such as points issued, total visits, purchases, and so on at the customer level, i.e., basically the columns which are summarized.  However, if you need these values for a specific duration, you need custom templates.\nTo create a custom template, see Creating Custom Templates.\nThere are over 20 different standard templates categorized as Fact, Dimension, and Fraud as mentioned below:\nFact\nCustomer Merge Event Log\nPoints Expiry Reminder\nTransaction\nRegistration Event Log\nFootfall\nCall Tasks\nMessages\nIssue Trackers\nReturn Transactions\nSlab Change Log\nProfiles\nContacted\nResponders\nPoints\nCoupons\nMembers\nbaseFactTemplate\nDimension\nitem - Inventory\nevent_zone_till - Stores\ncampaign - Campaign\ncampaign_group - Audience Group\nevent_user - Users\nFraud (Currently, there are no templates in this category)\ninitial_fraud_template\nTo select a template, do the following:\nIn\nExport Templates\n, click\nAdd/Remove\nTemplates.

In that case, this value of 1 indicates that the customer is visiting the store more frequently than expected in a short time, which could be flagged as suspicious or fraudulent activity.\nTransaction Hours Count in a Day\nDistinct_\ntransaction _hours > Threshold\nTransaction hours are the distinct hours in a day when the customer makes transactions.\nIf a customer exceeds a predefined number of distinct transaction hours in a single day, it may indicate unusual activity.\nThis rule helps identify patterns like multiple purchases spread across different times of the day, which could suggest fraudulent behavior.\nHigher than threshold indicates fraud (Multiple purchases across different hours)\nIf a customer purchases at 10 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, and 7 PM on the same day, the distinct transaction hours are 4 (10 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 7 PM). If the predefined threshold for distinct transaction hours is 3, this customer exceeds the limit. This could indicate unusual behavior, such as multiple transactions at various times of the day, which might be flagged for further investigation.\nTransaction Amount Limit\nMax_bill\n_amount > Threshold\nTransaction amount refers to the total value of a transaction.\nIf a customer's transaction exceeds a predefined threshold, the system flags the transaction as suspicious.\nHigher than threshold indicates fraud (Large transaction amounts)\nIf a customer makes a transaction with an amount significantly higher than the usual bill, for example, $1,500 when the predefined threshold is $500, the transaction exceeds the threshold. In this case, the customer will be flagged for further investigation, as this could indicate suspicious behavior.\nTop Customer Percentile\nLifetime_\npurchase\n_rank < Threshold\nEvaluates a customer's position in the total purchase value percentile (e.g., lifetime purchase rank). If a customer's Rank is lower than the predefined threshold (say 0.1), it means they are among the top spenders. These customers are flagged for potential fraud, as high-spending behavior could include unusual activities, such as adding others' transactions.\nLower than threshold indicates fraud (High lifetime purchase rank)\nIf a customer ranks in the 0.1 percentile with lifetime purchases totaling $500, but suddenly makes significantly larger purchases, their behavior may be inconsistent and flagged as suspicious.\nThis rule helps detect anomalies in spending patterns among top customers.\nTransactions in Different Zones\nMax_zones\n_with\n_billing on_same\n_day > Threshold\nIf a customer makes multiple transactions in different regions on the same day or with a gap of 6 hours, it could indicate suspicious behavior.\nHigher than threshold indicates fraud (Transactions in multiple regions in one day)\nIf a customer makes purchases in two different regions on the same day, such as in Region A at 10 AM and Region B at 3 PM, this might be flagged for investigation, as it is unusual to make purchases in two regions on the same day.\nVisits and Latency\nLatency outside threshold range\nVisits refers to the total number of store visits made by the customer.\nLatency is the average time between visits, calculated as: (last bill date−joined date)/(visits−1).\nThe customer is more prone to fraud if they have a high number of visits and low latency (frequency of visits over time).\nOutside the threshold range indicates fraud (Frequent visits in a short period)\nIf a customer has visited the store 10 times, and the time between the first and last visit is only 5 days, the latency =5/(10-1) = 5/9 = 0.56 days. If the threshold latency range is 0.1 and 2.0, this would be flagged as suspicious.\nSpike in Transaction Amounts\nHas_spike\n_bill = 1\nIf there is an increase/ spike in transaction amount, more than 10 times the average transaction amount, the customer is likely engaged in fraudulent activity.\nEqual or higher than threshold indicates fraud (Transaction far exceeding the average)\nIf the average transaction amount is $100 and a customer makes a $1,200 transaction, this amount is more than 10 times the average. This would be flagged for further investigation.\nTransaction per Day\nMax_bill\n_count\n_in_day > Threshold\nIf the customer makes more transactions in a day than a predefined critical value, it could indicate suspicious behavior.\nHigher than threshold indicates fraud (Excessive transactions in one day)\nIf a customer makes 15 transactions in one day, and the predefined critical value is 5, the customer will be flagged for fraud due to excessive transactions in a single day.\nTransaction per Week\nMax_bill\n_count\n_in_week > Threshold\nIf the customer makes more transactions in a week than a predefined critical value, it could indicate suspicious behavior.\nHigher than threshold indicates fraud (Excessive transactions in one week)\nIf a customer makes 30 transactions in a week, and the threshold value is 10, the customer will be flagged for fraud due to exceeding the number of transactions per week.\nLatency of Redemption\nRedemption_\nlatency outside threshold range\nRedeemed visits are visits where the customer has redeemed coupons or points.\nThe Latency of redemption is defined as (max date of redemption – min date of redemption) / (# unique days where points were redeemed– 1).\nIf the number of redeemed visits is more than a predefined value and the latency of redemption is less than a predefined value, then the customer is more likely to commit fraud.\nOutside the threshold range indicates fraud (Rapid redemption activity)\nIf a customer redeemed points 5 times in 2 days, with the latency of redemption being (2-1)/4 = 0.25 days, and the predefined threshold for latency is 1 day, this would indicate suspicious behavior.\nNumber of Times Points Redeemed\nRedeemed\n_visit\n_days  > Threshold\nIf the number of points redeemed by a customer exceeds a predefined threshold, the customer may be flagged for fraud.\nHigher than threshold indicates fraud (Excessive redemptions of points)\nIf a customer redeems points 15 times in one month, and the predefined threshold is 5, this customer could be flagged for fraudulent behavior due to excessive redemptions.\nRedeeming Rate\nRedeemed\n_rate > Threshold\n(Redeemed Visit Days) / (Awarded Visit Days)\nRedeemed Visit days are the number of days when the customer redeemed points. Awarded Visit Days are the number of days when the customer was awarded points.\nIf the ratio of redeemed visit days to awarded visit days exceeds a predefined value, it could indicate suspicious behavior.\nHigher than threshold indicates fraud (Excessive redemptions compared to awarded days)\nIf a customer has redeemed points on 8 days out of 10 awarded days, the ratio is 8/10 = 0.8. If the threshold is 0.5, it may suggest suspicious behavior.\nTotal Points Redeemed\nRedeemed\n_points\n> Threshold\nIf the total points redeemed by a customer exceeds a critical value, they may be flagged as fraud.\nHigher than threshold indicates fraud (Excessive points redeemed)\nIf a customer has redeemed 50000 points in one month, and the critical value is 25000 points, the customer will be flagged for fraud due to excessive redemptions.\n📘\nNote: If a brand needs to implement additional rules/ indicators, please contact the Data Science team.\nSample fraud management input template\nUpdated\n4 months ago\nTable of Contents\nTerminologies\nRules\nSample fraud management input template"

The weights help the brand to adjust the importance of every rule in finally considering the user as a fraud.\nGiven below are the steps followed in fraud detection:\nBrand provides the following:\nThreshold for each rule.\nWeight for each rule.\nCritical score value.\nThe fraud detection engine follows these steps for every user:\na. Evaluate each user against the 13 predefined fraud detection rules. And, whenever a user violates a rule, that is marked as 1 else 0.\nb. Calculates the score for each rule:\nMultiplies the weight (w) by 1 if the rule is violated.\nMultiplies the weight (w) by 0 if the rule is not violated.\nc. Sums the scores for all 13 rules to obtain the customer's total fraud score. If this total meets or exceeds the critical value (as defined by the brand or default 1.5), they are flagged as potential fraud.\nDiagrammatic representation of fraud score calculation\nConfirming the Fraud Status\nThe brand reviews the suspected fraud customer list (downloaded using the fraud export template) and can categorize each customer into the following fraud status:\nMarked\n: A customer who has shown fraudulent behavior, but yet to be confirmed.\nConfirmed\n: A customer who has been confirmed as a fraud (from the status \"marked\").\nReconfirmed\n: A confirmed fraud customer who has shown fraudulent behavior again.\nNot_Fraud\n: A customer who has shown fraudulent behavior, but later found to be not fraud.\nInternal\n: Internal Capillary users that make transactions and other activities for testing purposes.\nThese statuses are updated in the Intouch system through MemberCare or bulk upload via data import framework.\nConfigure Fraud Management\nTo use fraud detection, brands can follow the given steps:\nRaise a Jira ticket with the product support team.\nProvide the weightage and threshold values for the rules.\nProvide the critical score. Based on these values, Capillary can configure the 13 KPIs for the brand.\nBrand can then download the export template for fraud management.\nBrand can use the fraud template to download a list of potential fraud customers.\nBrand can mark the customers from the list, as fraud or not fraud, on an individual basis, using Member Care or by uploading them through the bulk import framework.\nFraud User Restrictions\nThe brand can define the restrictions for the customers who are\nCONFIRMED\n, or\nRECONFIRMED\nas fraud. These restrictions include:\nNot issuing them vouchers.\nProhibiting changes to their mobile numbers.\nPreventing them from redeeming points; and\nExcluding their information from all the reports.\nBrands can add the restrictions to customers through CDP. For more information, please refer to the\nrestrictions\ndocumentation.\nSample CSV file downloaded using the fraud template\nUpdated\n4 months ago\nTable of Contents\nConfirming the Fraud Status\nConfigure Fraud Management\nFraud User Restrictions"

This triggers a violation based on the \"\nTransaction per Day\n\" rule, as the number of transactions exceeds the threshold value of five transactions per day. Other factors such as the customer’s vintage-to-visit ratio, spike in transaction amounts, and transactions in different zone rules do not violate the predefined thresholds. Lets calculate the fraud score for this customer.\nThe following table gives the values used in fraud score calculation for this particular use case.\nPlease note that these values are provided only for demonstration purposes and would vary depending on the brand.\nRule\nOperator\nThreshold\nValue for the usecase\nWeight\nMultiplier (1 - violation, 0 - no violation)\nScore (Weight × Multiplier)\nReason for Multiplier\nVintage and Visit\n<\n2\n3\n1.0\n0 (no violation)\n1.0 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the customer's vintage-to-visit ratio was above the threshold.\nTransaction Hours Count in a Day\n>\n3\n1\n0.5\n0 (no violation)\n0.5 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the number of distinct transaction hours was below the threshold.\nTransaction Amount Limit\n>\n500\n400\n0.24\n0 (no violation)\n0.24 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the transaction amount did not exceed the threshold.\nTop Customer Percentile\n<\n0.1\n-\n0.49\n0 (no violation)\n0.49 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the customer is not in the top percentile for lifetime purchases.\nTransactions in Different Zones\n>\n3\n1\n1.0\n0 (no violation)\n1.0 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as all transactions occurred in the same zone on the same day.\nVisits and Latency\nRange\nBetween 0.1 and 2.0\n1\n1.0\n0 (no violation)\n1.0 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the latency was within the threshold range.\nSpike in Transaction Amounts\nEqual or higher\n1\n-\n0.25\n0 (no violation)\n0.25 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation, as there was no spike in transaction amounts.\nTransaction per Day\n>\n5\n6\n1.0\n1 (violation)\n1.0 × 1 = 1.0\nViolation, as the daily transaction count (6 in this case) exceeds the threshold (5).\nTransaction per Week\n>\n10\n4\n1.0\n0 (no violation)\n1.0 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the weekly transaction count was below the threshold.\nLatency of Redemption\nRange\nBetween 1.0 and 5.0\n3\n1.0\n0 (no violation)\n1.0 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the redemption latency was within the threshold range.\nNumber of Times Points Redeemed\n>\n5\n4\n1.0\n0 (no violation)\n1.0 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the number of point redemptions was below the threshold.\nRedeeming Rate\n>\n0.5\n0.2\n1.0\n0 (no violation)\n1.0 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the ratio of redeemed visit days to awarded days was below the threshold.\nTotal Points Redeemed\n>\n25000\n1000\n1.0\n0 (no violation)\n1.0 × 0 = 0.0\nNo violation as the total points redeemed were below the threshold.\nFinal Score\nSum of the scores:\n0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 +\n1.0\n+ 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 =\n1.0\nThe total score of 1.0 is\nbelow the critical value of 1.5\n, so the customer is flagged as\nNot Fraud\n.\nFinal Score (Sum of Scores)\nCritical Value Predefined by the Brand\nResult\n1.0\n1.5\nNot Fraud\nUpdated\n4 months ago"

What happens in that case?\nA: Yes, customers may be mistakenly flagged as fraud. The suspected fraud list is shared with the brand for investigation and confirmation. If a customer is wrongly marked as fraud, their status can be corrected using MemberCare.\nAre there any performance metrics like false positive rates or detection accuracy?\nA: No, performance metrics such as false positive rates or detection accuracy are not applicable because this is a rule-based system, not a prediction-based model.\nIs Fraud Management available for all brands by default?\nA: Yes, Fraud Management is available for all brands. However, brands must provide the threshold values for the predefined rules to activate this functionality.\nWhat are the limitations of this fraud management system?\nA: These are a few limitations of fraud management system:\nThe system supports only 13 predefined rules.\nComplex rules are not directly available and require external tools like Databricks for implementation.\nThis is a rule-based system and does not use predictive modeling.\nUpdated\n4 months ago"

Data Connectors enable you to connect your data sources to the Visulatisation tools securely without expensive re-engineering, testing, or retraining.\nWhat are the benefits of BI Tool Connector?\nAnswer -\nChallenges faced by visualization tools to read and analyze data through export framework can be minimized.\nTransformed and processed data can now be easily visualized on BI tools in a structured format as available in databricks.\nSeamless flow of information and easy integration with BI tools that also improve the data management process.\nNo more data migration issues, now you can easily plug and play data in any third-party visualization tool.\nEnable reporting which is not currently available in Insights+ due to technical or feature limitations.\nIt reduces the team's learning effort because the business expects SaaS vendors to integrate with their BI tools.\nHow can I access databricks Connector?\nAnswer - To access databricks connector, brand must have a databricks license. This is an add-on on existing databricks license.\nPlease raise a new request with databricks admin team to create a private cluster in databricks. You can drop an email to\nAccess Control\nwith the details.\nThe databricks admins will further create the cluster.\nOnce, the cluster is launched you can get the connector details under JDBC/ODBC tab.\nWhat can these connectors connect to?\nAnswer - We use the databricks connector to connect with any visualisation tool available in the market that has compatibility with databricks.\nWhat is a 'private' cluster?\nAnswer - A Databricks cluster is a set of computation resources and configurations on which you run data engineering, data science, and data analytics workloads. A 'private' cluster is a dedicated group of virtual machines launched for the brand. These machines are selected after analysis and this private cluster can only be accessed by admins and the customer POCs. The machines can be upgraded for improved performance.\nWhat are the advantages of the private cluster?\nAnswer -\nBetter data security.\nLimited access to users.\nBetter increased productivity and faster query results.\nCan I track usage of the infra on a monthly basis?\nAnswer - Yes, these can be requested by the databricks admin. The request will be reviewed and then processed by the databricks admin.\nHow to request access to brand's private cluster?\nAnswer - A new access request needs to raised with\nAccess Control\n, once the request is received it has to be approved by the customer POC and databricks admin will grant the request.\nWhat is the cost of the Databricks connector?\nAnswer - The databricks connector is bundled with the Databricks license, please contact the sales team for databricks license pricing.\nAre the KPIs and charts from Insights+ available with the databricks connector?\nAnswer - No, the brand's data analyst needs to create and visualize data in their BI tool. KPIs are required to be recalculated in the BI tool.\nWho will have access to the brand private cluster?\nAnswer - The brand has to provide the list of users that need access to their cluster, Capillary users must have the brand's consent and approval if they need access to the cluster.\nIs table-level access control possible at Databricks?\nAnswer - Yes, table-level access customisation is possible at Databricks. You can read more here -\nAccess control | Databricks on AWS\nWill the data be encrypted?\nAnswer - PII will be encrypted in databricks however, any data transfer medium or channel other than the Capillary SFTP service, will require the approval of the customer Information Security Head / CISO / Risk Head. Once the connection using the databricks connector is established, customer needs to control their data access in BI tools.\nWhat is the process to request a new cluster?\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago"

With this, demands to make the reporting customization have also increased.\nWe have now introduced the conversion of UI labels in Insights+ for the airline industry. For eg - Currently, across an organization, an airline vertical may not want to see points mentioned anywhere in its reporting view. Instead, you can now enable custom namespace conversion under the organization settings and points will be replaced with miles across the organization in Insights+.\nBelow images show how the UI labels change once the custom namespace feature is enabled.\nPlease note: The feature is now enabled for aviation-focused organizations initially on a pilot basis. We will be rolling out soon for other verticals over the next quarters.\nTo enable a custom namespace -\nGo to organization settings.\nUnder Organization Setup -> Organization Profile\nClick Edit.\nSelect Org Locale.\nClick on \"Enable Custom Namespace\"\nOnce the settings are applied click submit.\nNote : It takes 24 hours for the changes to take place across org.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago"

Once the ETL is done, the data gets masked.\nPerform the following steps to enable PII data masking:\nFrom the Rizer UI home page, navigate to\nPII configs\n.\nFor the brands you want to enable PII data masking, click\nConfigure\n.\nClick\nEnable\n.\nAfter enabling, when you export data, the PII fields are masked. Same steps can be followd to mask the PSI data.\nTo pause PII data masking, click\nPause\nand to disable PII data masking, click\nDisable\n.\nPSI Data Masking\nWhen\nPSI data masking is enabled for a brand\n, PSI fields including custom and extended fields, are masked in the Databricks. In the Analytics database (read_api tables), they are displayed as a string of asterisks (\"*\").\nCreate a Jira ticket for the product support team to pause or disable masking.\n📘\nNote\nTo access unmasked PSI data, jobs must be run on admin_read_api tables, which are restricted to authorized Databricks users.\nUpdated\nabout 2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nPII Data Masking\nPSI Data Masking"

A master job (implemented as a Databricks notebook) streamlines the management of all dependent jobs and is automatically triggered once the ETL process finishes. This ensures that all downstream tasks are executed seamlessly using the latest data.\nSteps to enable this feature\nSubmit a request to the product support team by raising a task ticket. The support team configures the required settings and a job following the naming convention\nETL_SyncTrigger_<org_id>\nis created.\nLink jobs by adding tasks within the workflow in Databricks (detailed in the following section). Once linked, all jobs connected to the ETL\nSyncTrigger\n<org_id> job will execute automatically after the next ETL process is completed.\nSteps to link the notebook\nNavigate to the\nDatabricks\nhome page.\nClick\nWorkflows\n. Once the support team has configured the settings,\nETL_SyncTrigger_<org_id>\nnotebook will appear in the workflows list.\nClick on the notebook name and open the notebook.\nClick\nTasks\n.\nClick\n+ Add task\n> select\nRun Job\n.\nNote\n: Make sure to click\nRun Job\nand not\nNotebook\nfrom the\n+ Add task\noptions.\nAll pre-configured jobs will be automatically populated.\nClick\nSave task\n. The data will be synced upon completion of the next ETL.\nUpdated\nabout 2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nSteps to enable this feature\nSteps to link the notebook"

To enable, contact your CSM.\nIf necessary, you can encrypt your export data to safeguard sensitive information. The export data is encrypted using a process that involves public-private key encryption. Users configure public keys for encryption within the Insights platform. These public keys are then used to encrypt the export data. When setting up an export, users have the option to choose the security type for encryption. They can select encryption and specify the public key to be used for encrypting the data. Once the export configuration is finalized and initiated, the export framework extracts the data and encrypts it using the selected public key. Only authorized parties with access to the corresponding private key can decrypt and access the original data.\nTo set the public keys, perform the following:\nNavigate to\nSettings > Public keys > Add new public key\n.\nEnter the following:\nKey name\n: Enter a name for the key. A \"key name\" is a unique identifier to provide some indication of its purpose or origin. It helps users easily identify and manage different public keys within a system.\nPublic username\n: Enter a unique username. A \"public user name\" for a key is a designation associated with the owner or entity to whom the public key belongs. It serves as a reference point for identifying the user or entity associated with the key, helping to organize and manage keys effectively, especially in scenarios where multiple users or entities may have their own keys\nPublic key\n: The public key can be generated using any PGP key generator.\nClick\nDone\n. A maximum of five keys can be added.\n📘\nNote\nYou can only edit a key and cannot delete a key.\nEditing a key\nYou can edit a public key. To edit, navigate to the list of public keys >  select edit option > make the necessary changes and click\nDone\n.\nNote:\nEditing a key will impact all the future exports of files encrypted using this public key.\nUpdated\n3 months ago\nTable of Contents\nData encryption settings for export\nEditing a key"
