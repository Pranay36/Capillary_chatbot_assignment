You can create a campaign for different marketing objectives, such as Sales promotion, New Store opening, Brand anniversary, Birthday, and many others.\nReach your customers by running campaigns over emails, SMS, social media, and in-store outlets via bulk or trigger messages. Capillary's campaign manager is also powered by customer analytics which helps in creating significant and personalized email/SMS campaigns and generating campaign reports.\nCampaign overall performance dashboard\n: Shows the overall performance of campaigns for the last 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.\nSearch Campaign\n: Enter the\ncampaign name\nin the search box.\nFilters campaigns by duration\n: Click the calendar icon to enter the duration in\nStart date\nand\nEnd date\n.\nFilter campaigns by status, marketing objective, and/or created by\n: Click on the\nfilters\nicon for advanced filters, choose the desired options, and click\nApply\n.\nCampaign status\n: Select Campaign status and choose from the following options.\nLive Shows: ongoing campaigns.\nUpcoming: Shows future campaigns.\nLapsed: Shows the past or inactive campaigns.\nMarketing Objective\n: The marketing objective is an option to define the purpose of your campaign. For example, Boost sales, Acquire customers, Promote specific products, and so on. To know more about marketing objectives, see\nMarketing Objective\n.\nCreated by\n:  This option allows you to filter campaigns created by a specific user. Select the user in the drop-down box.\nHow Engage+ is different from Loyalty+\nLoyalty promotions\nare based on customer activities, meaning a customer earns incentives upon performing a specific activity. For example, earning 2x points on a transaction during their birthday month or receiving 100 points for completing a running milestone.\nEngage promotions\nprimarily focus on issuing incentives in bulk and delivering them through broadcast campaigns. For instance, issuing 100 points and sending an email to all customers with a birthday this month. These do not require the customer to perform any specific activity.\nEngage also includes additional types of promotions:\nDVS (Dynamic Voucher System): Similar to loyalty promotions, these are activity-based, where customers earn incentives upon performing an activity. However, DVS promotions exclusively issue vouchers as incentives. These are typically used by brands not utilising loyalty promotions, as loyalty promotions offer a more comprehensive solution.\nReferral campaigns - Referral campaigns help acquire new customers by leveraging the networks of existing customers. Incentives for these campaigns can include coupons or points and can be configured to reward both the referrer and the referee. Rewards are typically based on specific actions, such as completing a registration or making a transaction.\nRole-based Access to Engage+\nWe can provide access to org users based on their access to each of the following actions or components.\nCreate campaigns\nCreate campaign messages\nApprove messages of a specific Incentive type - points, coupons, or both\nCreate an audience list using filters\nUpload audience list (CSV upload)\nCreate coupons (offers)\nView campaign reports\n📘\nBy default, a user is provided with all the permissions. To revoke access, log a Jira ticket.\nUpdated\n4 months ago\nTable of Contents\nHow Engage+ is different from Loyalty+\nRole-based Access to Engage+"

All these brands have their own loyalty program. Again, a customer can be part of more than one Loyalty Program.\nAn organization may partner with various other companies and have different partner-loyalty programs with different partners.\nFor example\n:\nA petroleum company has partnered with many companies. It has rolled out partner-loyalty programs with 130+ partners. It gives partner-co-branded loyalty cards to its customers. Customers use these cards during purchases and avail of points/discounts and other benefits. Again, a customer can be part of more than one partner-loyalty program.\nEither way, a customer from the same organization becomes part of multiple loyalty programs. To ensure personalized communication to customers, it becomes important to uniquely segment customers in the context of a particular loyalty program and then interact with them. This will help the brands to drive KPIs such as cross-vertical sales, and boost average transaction value, and transaction frequency.\nIn addition to the filter to segment customers based on their subscription to a specific loyalty program, the following filters are also added to the scope of the loyalty program.\nLoyalty program registration date\nActive points\nRedeemed points\nNumber of transactions\nFor Example\n:\nIf marketers were to identify customers who have more than 5000 active points from the loyalty program, then the active points filter should consider how many active points the customer has with this Loyalty program and not the total active points she has from all loyalty programs combined. This is achieved when\nthe scope/information about the loyalty program is passed to each filter\nfilters honor the scope and accordingly filter users.\nFeature updates\nThe following changes are added in Engage+.\nIn Campaign, Message users can now select a Loyalty Program. This selected program/ scope will be passed to Filters.\n📘\nWith this, if a loyalty program is chosen, then the audience through filters contains customers of that Loyalty Program.\nAny other filter chosen will work in accordance with the scope.\nIn the Campaign Message, users can select a Loyalty Program. This selected program/ scope will be passed to Labels.\n📘\nIf in creatives, any labels such as total_points, points_expiry_date are chosen, then the values of the loyalty program passed in scope.\nUse case\nCustomer Understanding\n: One customer can be part of multiple loyalty programs. A marketing manager would want to reach out to customers belonging to a certain loyalty program and send promotional messages with tags such as current points, card number, expiry date, coupons, and promotional points.\nIn a single promotional message, the marketing manager would not like to talk about different loyalty programs (as these could be entirely different organizations or partners).\nWith the new development, the scope gets restricted to the loyalty program chosen, so the audience targeted remains specific to the selected loyalty program and the labels resolve to values with respect to the selected loyalty program. Hence, the error of sending messages to non-intended audiences and the error of showing wrong points, card numbers, expiry dates, etc. in the content reduces significantly.\nLoyalty program-specific use case\n: A brand can have programs for different partners or sub-organizations. With each partner or sub-organization, they might want to focus on different strategies or objectives such as boosting sales, getting feedback, and running offers.\nFor example:\nIncrease transaction frequency: For Partner 1, if the brand wants to increase transaction frequency, using the Scope filter, the marketing manager will be able to first identify the audience for Partner 1 and then use transaction filters to identify customers with a low visit count for Partner 1 (only). Then the identified customers can be given relevant offers to promote visits to the store and transact with Partner 1.\nIncrease sales: Loyalty sales for sub-organization A/ Partner A is low. The marketing manager can identify the audience only for that loyalty program and run campaigns for increasing visits, ATV, ATB, etc. Communication/ offers can be personalized by segmenting customers. Filters such Recency < 3 months, ATV > $500, active point = 1000, transaction frequency = 7 times/ year etc. can be applied.\nPrerequisites\nOrg needs to have Multiple Loyalty Programs.\nBrand or Capillary POC can raise a ticket with the sustenance team requesting to enable the <> campaigns.\nEnhancements\nAdded Scope selection in the message creation flow to target customers belonging to a specific loyalty program.\n📘\nThis scope will remain valid throughout the Campaign Message and thus will get applied to Filters and Labels.\nTo use this feature, follow these steps.\nThe Loyalty program can be selected from the dropdown menu. Search functionality is also provided for ease of use.\nSince there can be multiple Card Series/ OUs belonging to the same Loyalty program, the selection needs to be done at the Card Series or OU level.\nUsage example:\nFor orgs, one loyalty program may encompass multiple card series. Hence, the scope can be selected at the Card Series level. Marketers can select Loyalty Program > Card Series.\nFor Petron Org, however, there is a 1-1 mapping between loyalty program and card series hence the scope can be selected at Card series structure.\nFor orgs such as Tata, one loyalty program like the Tata Group Loyalty Program may encompass loyalty programs for different OUs such as Titan, Tanishq, etc. Hence the scope can be selected at the OU level and hence marketers can select Loyalty Program > OU.\n📘\nOnce the scope is selected it will remain the same throughout the Campaign Message and cannot be changed.\nNone needs to be selected in case the Loyalty Program scope is not needed.\nFilters in Audience Manager will honor the selected scope: If any message scope is 'None’ then in Audience Group the selected Loyalty Program is passed as scope. The Filtered Customers List will have customers who belong to the selected Loyalty Program.\nCreating Audience by applying Filter:\nTransaction and Loyalty Filters can now understand scope definition -\nTransaction filter example\n: If Loyalty Program/Card Series A is selected and we give the condition “Include customers whose transaction count is 0-5 during specific date range\", then only customers of the card series A who have done less than 5 transactions appear in the list.\nSince one customer can belong to more than one Loyalty Program, 5 transactions might have been done with a combination of Card Series A/B/C. Without passing scope the identification of the right customer is not possible.\nLoyalty filter example\n: If Loyalty Program/Card Series A is selected and we give the condition “Include customers whose active points are in the range of 0-500 then customers who have less than 500 active points with Card Series A will only appear in the list.\nSince one customer can belong to more than one Loyalty Program, less than 500 points might have been with a combination of Card Series A+B+C. Without passing scope the identification of the right customer is not possible.\nLimitation: There is no way for Engage+ backend to understand if the Audience List (filtered/ uploaded) contains an Audience belonging to a single Loyalty Program/ Card Series type.\nIf the scope of the Campaign is Loyalty Program A / Card Series A and the audience list contains customers from card series A and B then people from series B will not be reached out/ skipped.\nHence, it is advisable to create an Audience list with the correct scope or upload a list with only one type of Loyalty program customer and then use the same in the Campaign.\nLabel resolution for content will be as per the selected scope\n: If for any message scope is ‘not-None’ then for Label resolution the selected Loyalty Program is passed as scope. The Loyalty and card-related Labels/ tags will get resolved for the respective Program only.\nFor example: If the selected Loyalty program is A and the tag used in creatives is {{total_points_to_expire_day(7)}} then the Card Series A points will be mentioned in the message.\nNew Labels for Card Series (Card Number, Card Issue Date, Card Series Name) have also been added.\nUsage Nuance:\nFor a petroleum company, one customer can have more than one card from the same Card series/ Loyalty Program. In case of any conflict on tag resolution, the card which was more recently used in a transaction or recently registered will be used.\nFuture scope\nMultiple Loyalty Programs selection in the scope:\nMarketers will be able to select more than one Loyalty Program as a scope. If Loyalty Program A and B are selected together then customers only in Loyalty Program A, only in Loyalty Program B, and both in Loyalty Program A & B will be part of the campaign. The tag resolution will also happen for both of the Loyalty Programs.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nFeature updates\nUse case\nPrerequisites\nEnhancements\nFuture scope\nMultiple Loyalty Programs selection in the scope:"

To know more about each tag, see\nMessage content section\n.\nYou can upload a file with a size limit of up to 10MB.\nTroubleshooting email image quality issues\n👍\nNotes\nDo not forcefully enlarge images.\nUse actual images or image URLs in zip files without enlarging them.\nIssue\nResolution\nFile size is getting reduced\nExpected behavior. File size reduction due to image transformations does not affect user experience. Specify image dimensions to maintain quality.\nFor example, if the email specifies a height and width of 200 x 300, images are transformed to match these dimensions instead of saving the original image, which might have very high dimensions. Consequently, the file size is reduced. This reduction could also occur due to dynamic image quality adjustments based on file sizes.\nImage getting compressed excessively\nCompression varies with file size. Smaller images have less compression; larger images undergo higher compression. This makes sure that irrespective of the file size, similar quality of images is achieved after compression. Do not artificially enlarge images to increase the file size.\nImages saved in avif format instead of jpeg\nImages are saved in their actual format except when the device supports avif format. avif format enables saving the images in smaller file sizes without impacting image quality.\nFor information on Generate OTP APIs, refer to the\nAPI documentation\n.\nUpdated\n6 days ago\nTable of Contents\nTo create a new email content\nUpload zip file\nCreate using the editor\nTroubleshooting email image quality issues"

As per the guidelines, the orgs that want to communicate with their customers will now have to register themselves with Telecom Operators for sending SMS. The system is governed using Blockchain technology also known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).\nMessage Categories\nFor DLT enabled organizations, the following are the three different SMS categories available.\nPromotional\n: Any message sent with an intention to promote or sell a product, goods, or service. Service content mixed with promotional content is also treated as promotional. Sender ID of 3-9 numeric digits needs to be used. Promotional messages sent to non-registered customers after receiving their consent will come under the category of Service Explicit.\nService Explicit\n: Any service message which doesn’t fall under the category of service message (inferred consent) will be considered a Service explicit message. To send such messages, the Sender ID of 3-9 alphabetic characters needs to be used. Promotional messages sent to registered customers after receiving their consent will come under the category of Service Explicit.\n3.\nService-Inferred/Implicit\n: Any message, arising out of the customer's actions or their relationship with the sender, that is not promotional, and is not in the interest of the customer to block. A sender ID of 3-9 alphabetic characters needs to be used. Notifications such as order confirmations, payment alerts, purchase updates, website/app login OTP, and other vital updates can be transmitted from Service Implicit route.\nPrerequisites\nAn Org should register itself on any of the DLT platforms and share the Entity ID with Capillary.\n📘\nTo make an org DLT enabled, raise a ticket and tag the Engage+ Sustenance team requesting to enable the DLT settings.\nFor existing Orgs, this will be taken care of as part of the Feature rollout process.\nDLT settings have to be enabled only for Indian clients.\nAn org should register Headers/ Sender IDs on the DLT platform. Multiple sender IDs can be registered under an Entity ID depending on the type of message.\n📘\nOnce the Header is registered it needs to be shared with the Capillary Gateways team (\n[email protected]\n). The Gateways team will do the Domain and Gateway mapping. This step is internal to Capillary.\nOrg needs to register Content templates in the DLT platform.\nUploading Template\nThe following are the key points to remember before uploading a file:\nYou can use only the templates that are currently active and approved by the DLT Portal.\nExisting templates with the same template ID will be overridden. For example, when you change a message related to a template ID in excel, it overrides the one which is in Engage+.\nDifferent DLT portals act differently and hence they can provide different CSV files. These may include whitespaces, curly braces({}), quotes(“”) or anything. Engage+ will take care of such things and trim the final file accordingly.\nTo upload an SMS template, follow these steps\nOn the dashboard, click\nCreatives\nand then click the\nSMS\ntab.\nClick\nUpload template\n.\nUpload the CSV file with all the required details.\n📘\nNote\nUsers can upload a file containing DLT approved content templates by clicking on the Upload Template button.\nFollow all the mentioned instructions.\nThe template will be successfully uploaded after it gets approved by TRAI.\nOnly the templates with valid Template name, Template ID, Type, Sender ID, Approval status, Status, Template message will be saved in Engage+.\nClick\nDone\n.\nColumns of a CSV file:\nThe sample CSV file contains the following mandatory fields that you need to upload:\nTemplate ID\n: Unique ID of the template. It is a 19 or 20 digit unique numeric identifier which is provided by the DLT portal.\nNote: To avoid shortening your value(truncation), you should change the type to text\nTemplate name\n: Unique name of the respective template.\nType\n: Specify whether the template is promotional, service explicit or service implicit.\nHeader\n: Sender ID used for broadcasting each message.\nRegistered DLT\n: It consists of the registered DLT portal that is used for the template. For example, Vodafone Idea or Jio.\nApproval Status\n: The current status of the template from the DLT’s end - approved, pending, or rejected.\nActual Status\n: It specifies if the template is active or inactive in the DLT portal.\nTemplate message\n: It contains the actual template message that the end-user will receive.\n📘\nIf there is an error in any row of the uploaded file, the template in that row will not be saved in the Capillary system. However, the file containing error details can be downloaded to check the errors.\nGuidelines to add links in Template\nYou can also add links in the template message. In India, as there is DLT compliance, users need to ensure the following guidelines while adding a link in SMS:\nThe users need to add the link in the {#var#} tag only so that the whitelisted template does not get affected. This is due to DLT compliance restrictions and hence adding links outside the {#var#} tag will result in template mismatch leading to delivery failure.\nIf there are any recurring messages that have links in SMS, the link has to be added in the {#var#} tag.\nIf there are templates set for coupon expiry reminders or resend messages and has links, these links must be added in the {#var#} tag otherwise, the campaign will fail once the feature gets enabled for your ORG.\nTo know how the link works internally, see the following:\nThe system replaces the mentioned link with an internal tiny URL.\nThe link added by you will be transformed, that is the appearance of the link which has to be tracked would change. For example, if the link is\nwww.google.com\n, it would be changed to s.cplry.com/7383936D89.\nThe changing of the link would also affect the characters of the SMS script. The replaced link would be 20-22 characters in length and hence the SMS character count can be changed by 15 characters (either add or remove). This could also affect the credits used for a particular SMS script.\nUsing approved templates\nOnce the file is successfully uploaded all the templates will be shown in Creatives > SMS.\n📘\nIn the campaign creation flow,  while adding creativity users can select any of the listed templates.\nSelecting the template will open the edit SMS screen. However, in the edit SMS screen, only the variable portion of the template can be edited.\nYou can replace the variables with static text or labels, but a maximum of 30 characters are allowed per variable {#var#} field. Hence, while adding text, users will be able to add a maximum of 30 characters. In case labels are used and a variable field resolves to more than 30 characters the message will fail for sure. Hence, the message for that user will be skipped by Engage+.\n📘\nIf length for any dynamic variable is more than 30 characters but less than 60, use {{var}} two times consecutively like {{var}}{{var}}. In that case, Engage+ will not skip the message. If the length is more than 60 characters but less than 90, use {{var}}{{var}}{{var}} and so on.\nYou can map a content template against multiple sender IDs.\n📘\nThe DLT portal allows this.\nIn such a case the user will have to select one of the sender ids that’s tagged to the content from the delivery settings section\nIf any of the sender IDs tagged to the content is not shown in the dropdown it means that the sender ID is not registered with Capillary. The gateways team should be contacted to have that sender ID registered with Capillary.\nView the details of failed messages (if any)\nDetails on the percentage of message failures with corresponding reasons will be available both on Engage+\nMessage Summary Page\nand\nMember Care\n.\nMessages might not get delivered due to the following reasons.\nError related to DLT template\nError related to Sender ID\nCustomers in the NDNC list\nCreate SMS template for other Orgs\nTo create an SMS template for other organizations (non-Indian organizations) refer to the following.\nOn the dashboard, click the\nCreatives\ntab and then click the\nSMS\ntab.\nClick\nCreate new\n.\nEnter a\nCreative name\n.\nEnter a\nCreative message\n. Click\n+Add Label\nto use appropriate tags in your message.\nClick\nSave\nNote\n:\nYou can see a sample view of your message on the right-side panel.\nOptout tag is compulsory to include. To know more about each tag, see the Message content section.\nIf you want to include special characters in your message content, select the\nAllow Unicode characters\ncheckbox.\nYou can also create SMS content from the\nCreate message\nsection.\nFor information on Generate OTP APIs, refer to the\nAPI documentation\n.\nUpdated\n2 days ago\nTable of Contents\nCreate SMS Template for Indian Orgs (as per TRAI Regulations)\nMessage Categories\nPrerequisites\nUploading Template\nTo upload an SMS template, follow these steps\nColumns of a CSV file:\nGuidelines to add links in Template\nTo know how the link works internally, see the following:\nUsing approved templates\nView the details of failed messages (if any)\nCreate SMS template for other Orgs"

It is aimed to replace SMS with a richer text format.\nRCS combines the messaging features of popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger but delivered through the default SMS messaging app. RCS is delivered as an SMS but supports extensive media support such as images, videos, branding, CTAs (Call to Actions) and more. Unlike SMS, RCS facilitates you to track the metrics of the message like open rate and link click rate.\n📘\nNote\nCurrently, RCS is only supported for Android devices through Google Messaging App. By default, this app is available in most of the Android devices. Customers can also download it from the Play Store if needed.\nCapillary provides various communication channels (SMS, Email, WhatsApp) to engage with brands' customers. With the advancing trends, it becomes very important to reach out to customers efficiently,  capture their attention, and keep them engaged.\nFeatures of RCS\nAllows brands to send media messages such as images, videos, and carousel media messages, add CTA buttons in messages. It also has better UX.\nEnables brands to have their verified profile, business profile picture, and bio which increases the brand’s verifiability.\nRCS offers detailed analytics of executed campaigns. This includes messages delivered, opened and link click rates.\nCapillary allows brands to configure fallback SMS within an RCS Campaign so that users who are not reachable on RCS can be automatically reached out through SMS.\nFallback SMS mechanism:  When a certain audience is not reachable through RCS, then the system will send the configured fallback SMS to the user. Brands can easily reach out to all customers through one campaign and do not need to run separate campaigns for RCS and SMS. A possible small set of users who might not receive will directly get an SMS, so communication to each user is done through one campaign.\nOther capabilities\nSend RCS text message\nSend RCS message with image\nSend RCS message with title and description\nSend RCS message with Image, Title and description\nSend RCS message with CTA button\nDetailed analytics of RCS campaigns\nConfigure fallback SMS in RCS campaign\nSend RCS message in video or carousel\nformat (upcoming)\nBenefits of RCS\nReduces the chances of customers blocking the brand\n: RCS messages are delivered in the SMS messaging box, where consumers are used to receiving promotional messages.\nBetter customer engagement: Through RCS  brands can engage their customers better by sharing high-resolution photos and videos, making it easier to add appointments to the calendar, mapping directions to physical outlets, sharing a carousel of products, and more.\nEnables running campaigns smoothly: RCS does not have template whitelisting, therefore a smoother process for brands to run campaigns.\nNo mandatory opt-out tag: RCS does not have a mandatory opt-out tag process. Hence, brands can leverage it to reach out to customers who are not reachable on another channel.\nAdvantages of using Capillary RCS\nBrands can attach and issue offers to customers and engage on the RCS channel.\nBrands can segment target users and runs RCS campaigns, which yields better ROI.\nProvides a detailed analytics of campaign performance, user-level insights, purchase pattern, and ROI from both the online and offline world which helps brands to take data-backed decisions.\nProvides fallback SMS functionality - brands can run a single RCS campaign to target all sets of customers and customers who are not reachable on RCS will receive an SMS.\nThere is no mandatory optout tag or approved templates required.\nOnboarding a brand\nTo enable RCS for a brand, you would need to fill in the onboarding form and send it to the RCS team  with the subject {Capillary Technology | RCS Account | brand name}.\nWe would then share the details with the Karix team for next steps and update you once the account is created. For more details, see\nhere\n.\nCreate an RCS template\nOnce RCS is configured for your brand, you can start with creating RCS message as mentioned in the following.\nOn Engage+, navigate to the\nCreatives\ntab.\nClick\nCreate new\n.\n📘\nIf you want to duplicate an existing template instead of creating from scratch, navigate to\nCreatives\n>\nRCS\ntab > Navigate to the respective template > Click more options (...) > Click\nDuplicate\n.\nIn\nCreative name\n, enter a name for the template.\nIn\nMedia\n, choose the desired media type.\nNone\n: To create a plain text message.\nImage\n: To create an image message and upload the image from your local system or Gallery.\n📘\nNote\nImage should be in JPEG, JPG, or PNG format, with dimensions up to 1440px × 720px and a maximum file size of 2MB.\nIn\nTitle\n, enter the title of the message if needed (supports up to 200 characters). You will see the title preview on the right side as you type.\nIn\nText message\n, enter the message content. Insert dynamic text in the message wherever required using\n+Add labels\n.  It supports up to 2000 characters. You can preview the message on the right-side as you type.\nCheck\nButtons\nto add CTA option in the message. Set the\nButton text\nand\nButton link\nof the CTA accordingly. Currently, you can have only one CTA.\nIn\nSMS message\n, you can set the fallback message for customers who could not receive RCS message. Fallback message allows sending  an SMS to customers who could not receive RCS. It could be because Google Communication App is not installed in their device, or using Non-Android phones like iPhone.\nUse dynamic text in the message wherever required using\n+Add Labels\n.\nFor DLT enabled brands, you will see an option to\nAdd SMS creative\n.  Just choose an approved template. However, for this you need to log on to the _Karix _portal and upload the DLT template for your brand as currently Google does not support DLT Compliance configurations.\nClick\nPreview\nto see how the SMS looks like and make necessary changes if required.\nClick\nDone\nto save.\n📘\nTo edit an existing template, on the\nCreatives\n>\nRCS\ntab, navigate to the respective template and click\nEdit\n.\nTo delete an existing template, on the\nCreatives\n>\nRCS\ntab > Navigate to the respective template > Click more options (...) > Click\nDelete\n.\nConfigure an RCS campaign\nThe steps involved in creating an RCS campaign is very similar to other types of campaigns except in _Content _and _Delivery _settings.\nCreate a campaign as mentioned\nCreate a Campaign\n.\nIn\nContent\n, select an RCS template that you wish to add.\nIn\nDelivery settings\n, you can change the sender ID for Fallback SMS. RCS sender ID is selected by default. By default, it will have the default SMS sender ID configured for the brand.\nView RCS reports\nMessage level report\nTo see the summary report\nOpen the campaign and navigate to the RCS message for which you want to see the performance report.\nMetric\nDescription\nContacted customers\nTotal number of customers contacted through the message.\nDelivery rate\nPercentage of messages delivered - (Total messages delivered/Total messages sent) * 100.\nHit rate\nThe percentage ratio of the total responders to the total contacted.\nResponder sales\nThe total sales generated by the recipients of the message during the campaign period.\nOpens\nThe total number of unique recipients that opened the message.\nClicks\nOut of the total messages delivered, the number of unique recipients that clicked on the link sent in the message.\nIncremental sales\nAdditional sales generated by the target group in comparison with the control group.\nCurrently, you can generate detailed report on RCS using Databricks Notebook. For this, you would need Org ID, campaign name, and the message name.\nYou can view two types of report:\nRCS message level report\nCampaign level report\nUpdated\n2 days ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nFeatures of RCS\nBenefits of RCS\nAdvantages of using Capillary RCS\nOnboarding a brand\nCreate an RCS template\nConfigure an RCS campaign\nView RCS reports"

Once WhatsApp has approved your template, you can use the message template to send notifications.\nYou can use WhatsApp channel to notify your customers about various offers and discounts, transaction, shipping information, OTPs and many more details through WhatsApp. Engage+ and Loyalty+ both supports WhatsApp notifications.\nOnce you create a template in Creatives, we get it approved for you without any additional effort from your end.\n📘\nNote\nCapillary makes use of a Business Service Provider which acts as a gateway between Capillary and WhatsApp. As Capillary maintains your brand's customer data, It is suggested to use Capillary over any Business Service Providers. It reduces your efforts to send data again to a new service provider.\nCreate WhatsApp template & Send for approval\nOn the Creatives page, navigate to the WhatsApp tab.\nClick on Create new.\nIn the Template name box, enter a unique name and it can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and underscores (_).\n📘\nTip\nUse a name that helps WhatsApp’s reviewer understand the purpose of your message, for example \"order_delivery\" rather than \"template_1\"\nExamples\nCreating a welcome message where the message template name is welcome and the message is\n\"Welcome {{1}}. We look forward to serving you on WhatsApp.\"\nCreating an order confirmation message where the message template name is Payment_confirmation and the message is\n\" We have received a payment of {{1}}} for your order no. {{1}}.”\nIn Template category, select the template category from the options available. Your WhatsApp message templates need to be aligned with one of the following categories. Templates that do not align clearly with the specified template type are more likely to be rejected by WhatsApp during the template approval process.\nUtility:\nShare account updates, order updates, alerts and more to share important information.\nMarketing:\nSend promotional offers, product announcements, and more to increase engagement and awareness.\nAuthentication:\nThis communication includes personal authentication information such as receiving OTPs from brands.\n📘\nNote\nIf you select\nMarketing\nunder the Template Category, and choose\nCarousel\nas the media type, you can add multiple images to your template. Start by adding the first image along with the body text and other required details, then save it. Once saved, you'll be able to add additional images to the carousel.\nIn Message, type a relevant message that you want to send. The message content should be as per the template category.\nCustom tags in message: Whatsapp does not support custom tags. If you want to use custom tags in the template, replace tag names with numeric values in a sequential order. Once the template is approved, you can replace numeric values with the actual tags before sending.\nFor example, If your message is: Hi {{firstname}}, here is your voucher {{voucher_code}} for our EOSS.\nYou need to send it as: Hi {{1}}, here is your voucher {{2}} for our EOSS.\nAdd links in your template: You may send URLs in a template. For example, “Thanks for registering with Demo Business. To continue, click on\nhttps://app.example.com”\n. For recipients to see the preview of the link in the message, you need to have an Official WhatsApp Business Account.\n📘\nNote\nYou can select the content language provided by WhatsApp.\nYou can upload a image with a size limit of up to 5MB. Supported formats: JPEG, JPG, PNG.\nYou can upload a video with a file size limit of up to 16MB. Supported Format: MP4.\nYou can upload a document with a size limit up to 16MB. Supported Format: PDF.\nClick on Send for approval.\nCapillary then sends the template to WhatsApp for approval. You can check the status of the template:\nAwaiting Approval: The template is under review and yet to be approved by WhatsApp as per their norms. (Orange dot)\nApproved: The template has been approved successfully. You can start using approved templates.  (Green dot)\nRejected: The template is not approved. Check if the template is as per the WhatsApp guidelines. Modify the template accordingly and send it for approval again. (Red dot)\nMessage template approval criteria\nYour template text should make it clear to the end-user why they received your message.\nTips and guidelines\nHere are some guidelines for increasing the odds of getting your template approved:\nPlaceholders must have double curly braces, such as {{1}}; single curly braces will not work.\nTemplates must have a specific, self-evident purpose.\nFor example: “{{1}} {{2}}” would be rejected because it could be abused to spam users. You need to surround the parameters with information so that it’s clear what type of information will be inserted.\nTemplates should be concise and convey only the necessary information that aligns with the template category. We suggest getting feedback from others to ensure that the template text is clear.\nTemplates must not have any grammatical or spelling mistakes. Templates that include even minor spelling or grammatical mistakes are likely to be rejected by WhatsApp.\nTemplates should be tagged with the appropriate category and language.\nOnce the template is approved, it is available in the WhatsApp tab and has a green dot next to it indicating that the template has been approved. You can then use it to broadcast messages to your customer base. You can also change the dynamic tags after the template has been approved accordingly.\n📘\nNote\nOnce you submit a template, it cannot be edited.\nProbable reasons for template rejection\nThe message template(s) contain content that violates WhatsApp’s Commerce Policy.\nThe message template(s) contain content that violates WhatsApp’s Business Policy\nDo not request sensitive identifiers from users. For example, do not ask people to share full length individual payment card numbers, financial account numbers, National Identification numbers, or other sensitive identifiers. This also includes not requesting documents from users that might contain sensitive identifiers.\nA survey after an experience is fine, but do not submit a survey or poll to collect unrelated data from users.\nExample: “Hi, we're interested in knowing how you feel about certain food groups. Do you mind participating in a survey?”\nThe message template(s) contain potentially abusive or threatening content\nExamples of approved and rejected message templates\nApproved message templates\nWelcome {{1}}. What company do you work for?\nYour {{1}} appointment is coming up on {{2}}.\nYour {{1}} appointment is coming up on {{2}}. Reply with {{3}} or {{4}}\nUnfortunately your pending booking did not go through.\nNo charges were made to your bank account.\nYou can try to rebook the hotel again.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.\nRejected message templates\nThe following templates don’t provide sufficient detail on how they will be used\nReminder: {{1}}\n{{1}} was added\n{{1}}, {{2}}!\nSpam message templates\nThe following templates are considered spam, as they do not make it clear to the user why they are receiving this message.\nI am Jenn, the virtual assistant.\nGuidelines for using WhatsApp for business\nYou should not spam your customers all at one, instead you should start slow so that customers who are not interested can unsubscribe instead of blocking permanently.\nYour message should be in sync with the notification category otherwise the chances of not getting it approved increases.\nWhatsApp limitation only allows 120 msgs/sec (rate-limit) and Capillary suggests to send up to 25-60 msgs/sec.\nYou can increase this throughput by having multiple phone numbers but this is not suggested as it makes it difficult to improve ratings for businesses.\nFor information on Generate OTP APIs, refer to the\nAPI documentation\n.\nUpdated\n1 day ago\nTable of Contents\nCreate WhatsApp template & Send for approval\nExamples\nMessage template approval criteria\nGuidelines for using WhatsApp for business"

The in-app messages are powered by Capillary's SDK. You can use the In-app messages when configuring campaigns.\nUse Cases:\nMarketeer intends to display an in-app communication to the customer when they first launch the app within a specified period, such as from June 1st to June 30th.\nMarketeer aims to present an in-app communication to the customer when they share a product with a friend.\nConfiguring In-App Messages\nOn\nEngage+\n, go to the Home page and click on\nCreatives.\nSelect\nin app message\n.\nSelect the In-app Message Account to send the content.

The image size should be 5 MB and in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.\nIf required, add a deeplink (link to any page in the mobile app) to the content of the in-app message or image. The deep links are added by the Capillary CSM/config team and is available for selection in the drop-down.\nSelect\nCall to action\nif you want to add a primary button in the notification message.\nEnter a button label. Select Deep-link or External link. Deep-link redirects the button action to a page within the mobile app. The external link redirects the button action to an external web page.\nClick\nSave\n.\nClick\nCreate\nto finalize the in-app message.\nThe in-app message is now created.\nUpdated\n9 days ago\nTable of Contents\nUse Cases:\nConfiguring In-App Messages"

This enables brands to maintain separate WhatsApp numbers for transactional/utility and promotional communication.\nAdding a new WhatsApp number to the source account\nTo add a new number under the source account, the CS/gateway team needs to raise a request to the tech/PST team, who can assist with the process.\nOnce the numbers are added, you can select the desired number in the Delivery Settings when configuring a campaign message. This allows you to choose the specific number from which you want to trigger the campaign message.\nMultiple WhatsApp sender number use cases\nTo prevent users from blocking or archiving your chat on WhatsApp:\nA common scenario where having different numbers for transactional and marketing communications is beneficial is when you aim to prevent users from blocking or archiving your chat on WhatsApp, thereby avoiding the loss of both promotional and useful information sent via the same number.\nOn the occasion of the suspension of a number\nPlatforms like Meta have the authority to take them down if customers consistently block or report the chat in large numbers. Brands, therefore, opt not to rely on a single number for any communication to mitigate such risks.\nDelivery settings for messages except for call tasks\nConfigure SMS Sender IDs\nOn the dashboard, click the\nSettings\nicon.\nSMS sender detail\nSMS Domain\n: Select an SMS domain from the drop-down list. The SMS will be sent from the selected domain.\nSMS GSM sender ID\n: Select an SMS gsm sender ID.\nSMS CDMA sender ID\n: Select an SMS CDMA sender ID.\nEmail Notifications to POCs\nSend to POCs\n: POCs (Point of Contacts) are the brand user group. Enable this option to send messages to the POCs as well. The messages will be sent based on the delivery schedule\nTo create a POCs group, follow these steps.\nOn the dashboard, click the\nsettings\nicon.\nClick\nUsers groups\n, and then click\nCreate user group\n.\nIn\nName\n, enter a group name for POCs users.\nIn the\nAll contacts tab\n, select users by clicking\n+Add\nnext to it, and then click\nDone\n.\nEnable Tiny URL\nUse tiny URL\n: Enabling this option will reduce the URL's length, whereas, the URL destination will not be affected.\nDelivery settings (Call Tasks)\nThe delivery setting allows you to set the call task expiry period, enable target DND, store to perform call task, track specific status for the call task, enable POC, and use a tiny URL.\nConfigure call task expiry period\nA store associate can see the task notification for the specified duration(days) from the message triggered to date. After the expiry period, the call task content will disappear from the destination app (InStore/Store2Door).\nYou cannot have call task expiry beyond the campaign expiry date.\nFor example,\nConsider a call task campaign with a start date and execution date is April 20, 2021, and an end date is April 25, 2021.\nFor one time campaign\nIf the call task expiry is set to 3 days, the message will disappear on InStore/Store2Door after 3 days from the execution date - April 23, 2021.\nIf the call task expiry is set to 7 days, the message will disappear along with the campaign expiry - April 25, 2021.\nFor recurring campaign (assume daily with the campaign expiry as 3 days\nThe message that triggers on April 20,  will be available until Apr 23 (end).\nThe message that triggers on April 21,  will be available on Apr 24 (end).\nThe message that triggers on April 22,  will be available on Apr 25 (end).\nThe message that triggers on April 23, 24, and 25 will also disappear on Apr 25 (end).\nTarget DND Users\nMobile SMS messages are blocked for users who have marked themselves as\nDND (Do Not Disturb)\n. By default, messages are not sent to DND users, but you can manually enable messaging for them if required. This is useful for checking reachability if those DND users have opted out of DND.\nTo allow messages to be sent to DND users:\nEnable the\nNDNC\ntoggle to send messages to customers subscribed to DND.\nBy default, this option is\nnot available\nfor all organisations. To enable it, navigate to\n{hostURL}orgadmin/administer/{orgID}\nand enable the\nSend to NDNC Customer\noption.\nStore to perform call task\nYou can assign call tasks to the store where the customer is registered or last purchased.\nCall task status\nTo configure the call task status, follow these steps.\nEnable the task status(\nOpen\n,\nClosed\n, and\nInProgress\n) using the checkbox. Enabled options will appear to store staff for updating the task progress.\nSelect the default status using the drop-down option.\n📘\nOnly enabled status can appear in the\nDefault Status\ndrop-down option.\nTo configure the custom label name for each status, navigate to\nEngage+\n>\nSettings\n>\nCall Task\n.\nSend communication to control customers\nIn general, Test Audience/Customers are the selected group of customers or audience to whom all communication messages are sent. Control Audience/Customers are the selected group of customers or audience for whom messages are not sent. The brand decides the ratio and group of the Test-Control audience.\nBy default, the campaign communication messages are not sent to the Control customers but only to the Test customers. You can turn on the toggle switch to enable sending communications to Control customers.\nA confirmation message is displayed on enabling the option. Select\nYes, send\nto proceed.\nUse case\nYou can enable this option in scenarios such as:\nsending communication about a brand's promotional program to all customers\nsending feedback form and collect feedback from all the customers\nsending any emergency communication\nevent invitation to all customers\nUpdated\n10 days ago\nTable of Contents\nConfiguring WhatsApp sender details\nWhatsApp Support for Multiple Numbers under One (WABA) Account\nAdding a new WhatsApp number to the source account\nDelivery settings for messages except for call tasks\nConfigure SMS Sender IDs\nDelivery settings (Call Tasks)"

Like capillary tech. wants to communicate regarding Capillary academy programs this will be the label for them -\nSender/Reply to ID: Here Sender ID refers to the email id that the org wants to use to send the email. e.g. in the above image \"\n[email protected]\n\" is the sender id.\nThe org chooses one of the two options, either they choose the sender id itself to receive the reply mail or they use the \"Reply to\" Email ID for getting the reply mail separately.\nCustom/Capillary IP: The IP address that we use while sending the email can be of two types, either Custom IP(dedicated to the brand) or Capillary's IP.\nGenerally, well-established brands use a custom IP address.\nWhereas the brands new in the journey use the Capillary IP address. This is done to avoid sending emails to the Spam mail section. This all depends on the IP ranking based on the authenticity that is done by the Email providers(e.g. Gmail & Yahoo)\nStep 2\n: Now if the client opts for Custom IP then a relay ticket is generated to the gateways team. Here Gateway team follows a convention for naming these domains.\nIntouch(our system)--> Send Grid(vendor)\nStep 3\n: Here we have to create the sub-account on the vendor side. Creation of the DNS records for the domains. DNS details are to be added to the client panel and verified at the backend.\nStep 4\n: The CSMs or the gateway team can enter the existing details in -\nOrg Settings > Domain Mapping+Channel Count Info\nStep 5\n: For OTP & Transactional mails, the config team/CSMs should enter details in -\nOrg Settings > Setup Wizard > Campaigns\nThere can be scenarios wherein emails get soft/hard bounced which eventually starts to impact the delivery. In this case, all you need to do is whitelist such emails (which are unable to receive messages triggered from Capillary), on the Capillary Engage+ setting. We now give the option to upload and whitelist a bigger chunk of emails at once.\nYou can find this option under Engage+ settings.\nGo to Engage+ settings > Email whitelisting > Upload the csv > Done!\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nEmail Client onboarding"

Promotions are applied as per the following ranking.\n10% off on shoes\nBuy 1 towel & get 1 free\n10% off on cart for purchases above 99\nLineitem\nQuantity\nValue\nAmount\nAfter promotion discount (#1, #2)\nShoes\n1 (pair)\n$100\n$100\n$90\nTowel\n2\n$10\n$20\n$10\nTotal\n3\n$ 110\n$120\n$100\nNow as per the option, promotion #3 is applied on the cart subtotal (after the line-item promotion is applied) -$100.\nCart or line-item with cart first: Select this option to apply for cart promotions first. If cart promotions are not available, then apply for line-item promotions.\nConsidering the previous example, only Promotion #3 (cart promotion) will be applied.  No line item promotions are applied.\nEnable multiple promotions for a single lineitem\nEnable this option to allow multiple promotions on different quantities of a line item or SKU.\nFor example, consider the following items in the cart.\n2 coke\n3 biscuits\n1 chai\nIf this is enabled, then multiple promotions are applied (see the below example)\n10 off on one coke\n10% off on coke\nSelect promotion ranking strategy\nWhen there are multiple promotions applicable for cart items (cart or catalog discount), you can define the ranking of promotions before applying them.\nThe promotion is either based on the maximum discount or earliest expiry. However, there could be instances where more than one promotion could be applicable to the cart or product. The secondary parameter is auto-applied in such cases.\nEarliest expiry\n: Select this to associate the promotion that has the earliest expiry date compared to other promotions that are applicable.\nFor example, assume the following promotions are applicable for Cart items - 2 shirts,3 Jeans, and 1 t-shirt - the following promotions are applicable.\n100 off on T-shirts expiring in 3 days.\n20% off on jeans expiring in 7 days.\n10% off on jeans expiring in 5 days.\n100 off on shirt each shirt expiring in 1 day.\n10% off shirts expiring in 10 days.\nBuy 1 shirt get 1 shirt expiring in 1 day\nIn this, the promotions are sorted by the expiry date and applied as follows.\nBuy 1 shirt get 1 shirt expiring in 1 day -\nApplied\n100 off on shirt each shirt expiring in 1 day\n100 off on T-shirt expiring in 3 days -\nApplied\n10% off on jeans expiring in 5 days-\nApplied\n20% off on jeans expiring in 7 days\n10% off shirts expiring in 10 days\nIn this example, you could observe that two promotions 1 and 2 (applicable on shirts) have the same expiry. In such cases, the system applies the one that was created earlier (say the first promotion was created earlier).\nMaximum discount\n:  The promotion with the maximum discount value is considered. However, if there is more than one promotion with the same maximum discount value, among these promotions, the one that expires earlier is considered.\n📘\nIf the conflict still persists, then the system would choose a promotion randomly.\nEnable ranking based on promotion type\nEnable this option to prioritize the promotions.\nPromotion first\n: Select this to prioritize normal promotion programs such as Loyalty, Loyalty earning, and POS promotions when normal, reward promotions and code-based promotions are applicable.\nRewards first\n: Select this to apply all promotions purchased from the rewards catalog (Marvel rewards) irrespective of any other settings. If the org has multiple promotions per line item disabled,  the setting is bypassed and multiple rewards will apply.  Rewards are essentially considered pre-bought gift items.\nCode first\n: Select this to prioritize code-based promotions over customer or reward-linked promotions.\nCart promotions module previously offered three options for ranking strategies in cart promotions, including reward-based promotions, code-linked promotions, and customer promotions. However, within customer promotions, which include loyalty, loyalty earning, and POS promotions, there was no option for internal ranking.\nTo address this, we have made enhancements to the promotion ranking strategy in cart promotions to include the ability to rank between loyalty, loyalty earning, and POS promotions.\nEx: a POS promotion can be ranked above loyalty or loyalty earning promotion. This ranking applies to both gift voucher (payment voucher) and cart promotions (discount).\nFor the orgs already using cart promotions stacking order, a confirmation message is added, post accepting, all types of promotions will be listed and\nthis action can't be reversed\nFor orgs that are not using promotion stacking order, all types of promotions will be available for stacking.\nAPI Changes:\n/v1/promotion-management/promotions/settings/\nNew parameter issuanceTypePromotionRanking is added with default false. This ensures backward compatibility and flexibility that the new elements are optional.\nNew parameters are added to Reward Ranking Strategy:\nPOS_PROMOTION_FIRST\nREWARDS_FIRST\nCODE_FIRST\nTo get started,\nWhen issuanceTypePromotionRanking is set to true, 3 new types are added as follows:\nPOS Promotion\nLoyalty Promotion (Translates to customer promotion in backend)\nEarning Promotion\nPROMOTION_FIRST will not be added in request, instead PROMOTION_FIRST will be replaced with the new types mentioned above.\nFor eg if your ranking strategy is as per below,\nPOS promotion\nLoyalty promotion\nLoyalty earning promotion\nReward-linked promotion\nCode-based promotion\nBelow sample shows the payload that needs to be passed as request\nhttps://{{url}}/v1/promotion-management/promotions/settings/strategy\n{\n\"rewardRankingStrategies\": [\n    \"POS_PROMOTION_FIRST\",\n    \"LOYALTY_PROMOTION_FIRST\",\n    \"EARNING_PROMOTION_FIRST\",\n    \"REWARDS_FIRST\",\n    \"CODE_FIRST\"\n    ],\n    \"issuanceTypePromotionRanking\": true\n  }\nWhen issuanceTypePromotionRanking is set to false, all the other promotions other than reward and code based (i.e POS, Earning and Customer based) are treated as one unit.\nThese changes will be applicable to all modes such as discount, payment vouchers and tenders.\nExample 1\nRequirement: Brands want to apply POS promotion first, then code-based promotions, and then rest of the promotions.\nBased on the old feature, brands could rank code-based promotion first or loyalty promotion first (where the default ranking is loyalty, loyalty earning and POS)\nExisting strategy: loyalty, reward-linked, code-based\nPromo Type\nType\nRanking\n10% discount to customers who purchase more than $50 worth of goods at a time.\nPOS\n3\n5% discount on all items in the store for customers who enter the code \"SAVE20\" at checkout\nCode-based\n4\nPayment mode discounts :10% always off on HDFC bank cards\nLoyalty Promotions (tender based)\n1\nGet a flat 15% off on your purchase when you sign-up for email updates. The offer applies to the first 250 customers and each customer can avail the offer only once.\nLoyalty Earned Promotions\n2\nBased on the enhancement, brands can now rank any promotion first i.e POS can come before code-based promotion and loyalty earned promotion can come after code-based promotion.\nNew strategy: POS, code-based, loyalty, loyalty earned\nPromo Type\nType\nRanking\n10% discount to customers who purchase more than $50 worth of goods at a time.\nPOS\n1\n5% discount on all items in the store for customers who enter the code \"SAVE20\" at checkout\nCode-based\n2\nPayment mode discounts  :10% always off on HDFC bank cards\nLoyalty Promotions (tender based)\n3\nGet a flat 15% off on your purchase when you sign-up for email updates. The offer applies to the first 250 customers and each customer can avail the offer only once.\nLoyalty Earned Promotions\n4\nExample 2 - Fuel vertical\nBrands want to apply POS promotions first (both for loyalty and non-loyalty customers) and then apply the rest of the promotions based on the selected strategy i.e. POS can be ranked higher than loyalty & loyalty earning. However if there is another POS promotion that gives a better discount, then it will be ranked higher and will apply.\nPromo Type\nType\nRanking\nCalculated on\nFuel Discount\nEg. 5% off for all customers on Fuel\nPOS\n1\nNet Amount of the line item received from POS i.e SaleItems.Amount\nFuel Discount\nEg. National Day Offer: 2% off on all grades of Fuel\nPOS\n2\nNet Amount of the line item received from POS i.e SaleItems.Amount\nPayment mode discounts\n10% always off on CITI bank cards\nLoyalty Promotions (tender based)\n3\nTender Value allocated to the line item/ SKU\nPOS discounts along with MOP discounts\nAmount\nRanking\nFuel\n100\nCanopy-5%\n5\n1\nNational day-2%\n2\n2\nCITI bank -10%\n10\n3\nTender based promotions are always applied after regular promotions. After processing promotions for a customer, MOP discounts are processed and are applied separately.\nCautionary Note: Until UI is available\nif issuanceTypePromotionRanking is false, then there are no issues in the UI and setup of ranking.\nif issuanceTypePromotionRanking is true, then brands can use the API to define the ranking of promotions and it will work but later, if they use the UI to make any changes and save it then it will reverse to the original state.\nAPI endpoint and request body\nhere\nCustom fields\nYou can add promotion level custom fields (meta-information) that are required for your promotion. For example, you can include Terms & Conditions, Disclaimer, and so on.\nTo add promotion custom fields:\nIn Custom Fields, click\nAdd custom field\nIn\nName\n, enter the name of the custom field.\nIn Datatype, choose the input value supported for the custom field -\nDate\n(for date fields),\nNumber\n(to input numeric values),\nString\n(to input alpha-numeric values).\nIf the field is required to create a promotion, check\nMandatory\n.\nClick\nSave\n.\nYou can see the fields you added here in the Additional Information section of the promotion configuration page.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nSelect cart & line item evaluation mechanism\nEnable multiple promotions for a single lineitem\nSelect promotion ranking strategy\nEnable ranking based on promotion type\nAPI Changes:\nCustom fields"

Click on the section that you want to configure.\nPrioritize voucher redemption by\nVoucher rounding logic\nManager custom fields\nPrioritize voucher redemption by/\n1. Voucher Type\nUnder this section, you will see a toggle button for voucher type. It is non movable and will always remain at the top priority. So, while redemption, the first priority will always be given to the type of voucher to be redeemed if this is enabled. When there are multiple promotions in the org, you can enable the toggle button and the drop down shows 3 kinds of promotions:\nLoyalty Vouchers - Drag this up to prioritize normal promotion programs such as Loyalty, Loyalty earning and POS promotions.\nReward Linked - Drag this up to apply all promotions purchased from the rewards catalog (Marvel rewards) irrespective of any other settings. If the org has multiple promotions per lineitem disabled,  the setting is bypassed and multiple rewards will apply. Rewards are essentially considered as pre-bought gift items.\nCode Linked - Drag this up to prioritize code linked promotions configured in the cart and catalog promotions.\n2. Maximum Value & Expiry First\nIn case of multiple vouchers, we can define the ranking for the vouchers, that which will get redeemed first. The vouchers are based on either maximum discount or earliest expiry.\nMaximum Value - Drag this up to associate the voucher with maximum discount value compared to other vouchers that are applicable.So, the vouchers with more discount values will apply first. However, if there is more than one voucher with the same maximum discount value, among these vouchers, the one that expires earlier is considered.\nExpiry First - Drag this up to associate the voucher that has the earliest expiry date compared to other vouchers that are applicable.\nFor example, assume the following vouchers are applicable.\nRiders -VCHR 9% expiring in 3 days\nRiders - VCHR 5% expiring in 7 days\nRiders - VCHR 8% expiring in 1 day\nSo, the vouchers will get sorted by expiry date and are applied as follows :\nRiders - VCHR 8% expiring in 1 day\nRiders -VCHR 9% expiring in 3 days\nRiders - VCHR 5% expiring in 7 days\nIf two vouchers have same expiry dates, then the voucher created first would be applied first.\nNOTE - If the conflict still persists, then the system would choose a promotion randomly.\nVoucher Rounding Logic\nSelect the rounding mode and the decimal precision required as per your billings.\nCustom Fields\nYou can add voucher level custom fields (meta-information) that are required for your gift vouchers. For example, you can include Terms & Conditions, Disclaimer and so on.\nTo add voucher custom fields :\nClick on Create custom field under the Manager custom fields.\nIn Name, enter the name of the custom field.\nIn Datatype, choose the input value supported for the custom field - Date (for date fields), Number (to input numeric values), String (to input alpha-numeric values).\nIf the field is required to create a promotion, enable the toggle is Mandatory from No to Yes.\nClick Save.\nYou can see the fields you added here on the same page below the Manage custom fields with the name, datatype and mandatory option. You can edit the custom field by clicking on the pen option against each row.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nPrioritize voucher redemption by/\n1. Voucher Type\n2.

This can also minimize the cost of communication by reaching out to cheap communication channels and maximize the probability of conversion by prioritizing channels that could give better ROI.\nThere are two different sequences of Channel Priority strategies supported.\nC1 /C2 / C3\n(Only one channel in the sequence of availability)\nAll customers are first contacted on Channel 1. If a customer is not reachable on C1, then we try to contact them on Channel 2. If a customer is not even available on Channel 2, then we try to contact them on Channel 3, and so on. In this, you need to configure at least two channels.\nC1 + C2 / C3 (One mandatory channel and any other remaining channel in the sequence of availability )\nAll customers are contacted on Channel 1 and additionally, you can try to contact on any other channels in the sequence of availability Channel 2, Channel 3, and so on. If a customer is not available on Channel 2, then we can target on Channel 3 and so on. In this, you need to configure at least three channels one mandatory channel and another channel in the sequence of availability.\nConfiguring C1/C2/C3\nTo configure for the first type of channel priority option, follow these steps.\nIn Content, select\nC1/C2/C3\nand click\nNext\n.\nAccording to the sequence in which you want to prioritize channels, set channels in each box. Channel 1 will have the highest priority, whereas, Channel 3 is the lowest.\nClick\nAdd Creative\nand configure a template for each Channel according to your preference (SMS/Email, Push Notifications, Live). You need to configure at least two channels (Channel 1 and Channel 2).\nClick\nAdd more content\n, to configure more channels.\nThe following screenshot has the channel priority set as follows:\nSMS\n>\nMobile Push\n>\nLine\n.\nTo send incentives on a specific channel, click the respective\n+Add Incentives\n. You can add an offer or a points strategy.\nConfiguring C1+C2/C3\nTo configure for the second type of channel priority option, follow these steps.\nIn Content, select\nC1+C2/C3\nand click\nNext\n.\nIn Channel 1, you need to configure a default channel and additionally, you can configure Channel 2 and Channel 3 in the order of priority. Here, Channel 2 will have the first priority and Channel 3 is second, and so on.\nClick\nAdd Creative\nand configure a template for each Channel according to your preference (SMS/Email, Push Notifications, Live). You need to configure at least two channels (Channel 1 and Channel 2).\nClick\nAdd more content\n, to configure more channels.\nTo add incentives for a channel, click\nAdd Incentive\n. You can add an offer or points.\nClick\nContinue\nto proceed.\nChannel priority in Journey\nYou can also use the channel priority feature when configuring a Journey. The Journey cannot be sent for approval, and an error message will be displayed if the channel priority is not configured properly.\nA Journey will not be saved, and an error message will be displayed in the following scenarios:\nBoth channels in the channel priority are the same. For example, if you configure SMS as C1 and C2 in the channel priority configuration, the system will not allow you to save the Journey, and an error message will be displayed.\nYou have added the Channel Priority block but have not configured the channels properly.\n📘\nNotes\nIf the customer is not reachable on any of the configured channels, no error will be displayed, and the Journey will progress to the next block.\nAt the time of executing this journey for any customer if the customer has unsubscribed from any channel, the communication is not sent on that particular channel.\nUpdated\n9 months ago\nTable of Contents\nConfiguring C1/C2/C3\nConfiguring C1+C2/C3\nChannel priority in Journey"

Assume the following data is available - Zoha earned 5 promotions in June, Raj\tearned 2\tpromotions in July, and Simran 4 promotions in June.\nHere, Zoha will be selected as she is the only one who earned more than three promotions in July.\nBasic filter options:\nBasic\nDate\nConsiders promotions earned in the specified period. You can choose duration either by\nSpecific dates\nor\nRelative days\n.\nPromotion earned count\nLets you filter customers whose number of earned promotions is in a specific range. You can select a range from minimum to maximum promotions.\nFor example, you can get customers who earned between 5 -10 promotions. You can also use the operators greater than equal, less than equal, equals and in range of.\nBehavioral event-based filters\nAs soon as a behavioural event is created and its data becomes available in Insights, an audience filter for that event can be used to segment users. These filters help create audience groups for bulk communications and refine reports in Insights based on event attributes, including segmentation by the number of times a user performed an event.\nFor example, if a new behavioural event is introduced to track user steps and the device type used for capturing the activity (e.g., Mobile/Smartwatch), brand managers can create an audience group such as:\n\"Users who have walked more than 500 steps in the last week and used a mobile device to capture the activity.\"\nFor more information on audience filter-based reporting, refer to the\nAudience group filter in reports\ndocumentation.\nUpdated\nabout 2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nCart & catalog promotions\nBehavioral event-based filters"

For example, last 9 days, next 2 weeks.\nThe following options are available for relative days:\nIn the last x\n:  Fetches customers who interacted with your brand in the last x days, weeks or months. For example, if you set 10 in the last x calendar week, you will get customers who interacted in the last ten weeks.\nIn the next x\n: Fetches customers who will interact with your brand in the next x days, weeks or months. For example, if you set 1 in the next x calendar week,  you will get customers who purchased a specific product(s) in the upcoming calendar week.\nIn the current x\n: Fetches customers who interacted with your brand on the current day, week or month.\nBetween days\n:  Fetches customers who  interacted with your brand between 'the last x days’ and 'the next y days'. For example, last 30 days until the next 15 days.\nExactly x days ago\n: Fetches customers who  interacted with your brand x days ago. For example, you can get the customers who made registration 10 days ago.\nExactly after x days\n: Fetches customers who will interact with your brand after x days from the current day. For example, you can get the customers who will purchase men's trousers on the 10th day from now. 1 is for tomorrow, 2 for the day after tomorrow and so on or you can get customers who will redeem coupons on the 4th day from now.\nStore Hierarchy\nThis option lets you filter customers by store(s) at which the activity is done. You can also select stores by zones and concepts. The activity could be customer registration, points/coupon redemption, profile update, etc.\nStore\nYou can filter customers by store(s) at which they performed a specific activity and select them using any of the following options:\nUpload list\n: Lets you upload store IDs using a CSV file. Select the upload list from the drop-down list. If you do not have the CSV file, then download the sample CSV file, add store IDs, and upload it.\nEnter values\n: Let's you search for stores manually. On the search box, enter a store name, and select the store name from the suggested list. You can add multiple stores.\nBased on attributes\n: Let you select store(s) based on attributes. You can select stores by attributes such as store name, type, store external ID, area, and more. You can select multiple attributes.\nOnce you select store attributes, select the values of each attribute from the available list. For example, to filter stores by city, select the store city from the attributes list, and in the store city list, select your preferred city name.\nZone/ Concept\nA zone is a geographical cluster of stores. A concept is a logical grouping of stores.You can filter customers by zones/concepts in which the customer performed a specific activity.  You can select stores of one or more zones/concepts using the following options:\nAny store\n: Selects all the stores of a selected zone(s)/ concept(s).\nStores with attributes\n: Use this to select stores by store attributes of the specified zone(s) concept(s). Store attributes could be store channel, store type, external ID, store area, store name, and more.\nOnce you choose a store attribute, select the values for each shop attribute from the recommended list. For example, to filter stores of a concept by city, choose the store city from the list of attributes, then choose your preferred city name from the store city list.\nPoints\nActive Points\nPoints that are available for a customer for redemption are active points.\nYou can use points range to get customers that have current points in a particular range. You can either include or exclude customers for a given condition.\nGreater than equal\n: Get customers that have current points greater than or equal to the value specified here\nLess than equal\n: Get customers that have current points less than or equal to the value  specified here\nEquals\n: Get customers that have a specific number of current points\nIn range of:  Get customers whose current points are between a specific range (including minimum points to maximum points).

You can select multiple statuses. For example, customers whose leads are currently Open or On hold.\nThe following are the standard statuses for leads. However, an org can create custom statuses as required.\nOpen\n: This is usually used for new leads that are not processed.\nWon\n: This is used for leads that are successfully converted.\nLost\n: This is used for leads that are not converted in a specific period. There is a config,\nCONF_LEAD_AUTO_CLOSURE_TIME_PERIOD\n, in InTouch\nSettings\n>\nMiscellaneous\n>\nLead Configuration\n. If a lead is not converted within that duration, the status is marked as Lost automatically.\nOn hold\n: This is used when the item the customer has given a timeline to decide on or the item is not available in the store currently.\nDeleted\n: This is usually used for unqualified or invalid leads.\nChannel\nLet you build an audience group based on their mobile number and email subscription status - Opt-in or Opt-out.\nEmail\n: Use this to get customers that registered their email id\nMobile\n: Use this to get customers that registered their mobile number\nWeb Engage\n: Use this to get customers that are subscribed to mobile push notifications\nLine\n: You can get customers that are registered in the brand's Line account\nEcommerce\n: Use this to get customers that are on the e-commerce platform of the brand\nWeChat\n: You can get customers that are registered in the brand's official WeChat account. WeChat is a communication channel like WhatsApp used in countries like China\nNDNC Status\nLet you build an audience group based on\nNDNC\n(National Do Not Disturb) status,\nNDNC\n,\nInvalid\n,\nDND\n, and\nUnknown\n. You can select more than one option.\nStatus\nNDNC\n: The abbreviation of the National Do Not Call Registry is the NDNC Registry that controls unsolicited communications. Might not be applicable to all countries\nDND\n: Customers that do not want to receive any unsolicited SMS or calls will register in Do Not Disturb (DND). You can get customers who registered their mobile numbers in DND. Might not be applicable to all countries.\nInvalid\n: Customers with invalid mobile numbers.\nUnknown\n: Customers whose status is currently unknown.\nNot captured\n: Customers whose status data are not captured.\nFraud\nMarked\n: A customer who has shown fraudulent behavior, but has yet to confirm by our team.\nConfirmed\n:  A customer was confirmed as a fraud (from the status \"marked\") by our team.\nReconfirmed\n: A confirmed fraud customer that has shown the fraudulent behavior again\nNot fraud\n: A customer that has shown a fraudulent behavior, but later our team has confirmed as not fraud\nInternal\n: Internal Capillary users that make transactions and other activities for testing purposes.\nNot applicable\n: The standard field is applicable for all the organizations; whenever the organization does not pass information collected from the customers, the system considers it not applicable. For example,  let us take the first name field in the user table. This is a standard field and most brands capture the first name of customers who are registered and passed into the Capillary system. However, if a brand does not capture and pass the customer's first name into the Capillary system (if there is no first name-value present in the customer's first name field in source data), the value in the first name field of the user table will show not applicable.\nInvalid\n: The source dimension attribute values are predefined in the system; whenever any value other than the predefined values is passed to the Capillary system, the system considers it invalid. For example, a specific brand has source dimension attributes with fixed values - Instore, Web_engage, App, and WeChat. Here, Facebook is not a pre-configured source dimension attribute. Therefore, if any customer gets registered via Facebook, and this source value is passed into the system, the system will not recognize it (Facebook). And the value for this dimension is invalid.\n📘\nSource\ndimension refers to the channel via which a customer registered with the brand.\nNot captured\n: The information that the brand collects from the customer during a transaction is entered into the Capillary system; whenever the brand passes null instead of this transaction information, the system considers it not captured. Let's take the same example mentioned in invalid status. If the client system fails to capture the channel (INSTORE, Web_Engage, App, or WeChat) where a customer is registered and passes a null value, the Capillary system saves the source dimension attribute value as not captured.\nFor more details on fraud tagging, fraud detection methodologies, fraud detection report execution in Essential Insights, and other fraud-related details refer to the attached PDF document.\nProduct filter\nThis lets you filter customers by products purchased. The following are the different options available for this filter.\nParent Category\n: Fetches customers who shopped products of a specific parent category(s). You can filter the results further using either any product of the selected category(s) or products with specific attributes. Attributes could be Brand name, image URL, price, style and so on.\nCategory\n: Fetches customers who shopped products of a specific category(s). You can filter the results further using either any product of the selected category(s) or products with specific attributes. Attributes could be Brand name, image URL, price, style and so on.\nItem Code\n: Fetches customers who purchased a specific item.  You can choose items either by uploading item codes (upload list), fetching manually (enter values) or by product attributes such as brand name, image URL, price, style, and so on (based on attribute).\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nDate filter\nLifetime\nSpecific dates\nRelative days\nStore Hierarchy\nStore\nZone/ Concept\nPoints\nActive Points\nExpired Points:\nLifetime Points\nLead Status\nCurrent Lead Status\nChannel\nNDNC Status\nStatus\nFraud\nProduct filter"

It helps determine if a particular user can receive messages or notifications sent through that channel.\nYou can view the reachability status in the audience view detail page.\nReachability Categories\nCategory\nReachability Status\nDescription\nVALID\n✅\nThe user is reachable and valid.\nSUBSCRIBED\n🟢\nThe user is reachable and has subscribed.\nUNABLE_TO_VERIFY\n❓\nUnable to verify the user’s reachability.\nSOFT_BOUNCED\n🔄\nThere were soft bounces. More may lead to HARD_BOUNCED.\nCONTACT_UNAVAILABLE\n🚫\nThe user’s registered contact is not available.\nUNSUBSCRIBED\n🔕\nThe user has unsubscribed from communications.\nINVALID\n❌\nThe user’s registered contact is invalid.\nHARD_BOUNCED\n🛑\nPrevious communications have HARD_BOUNCED.\nWhen is Reachability Calculated?\nImmediate and Specific Date Messages:\nReachability is computed before campaign creation.\nRecurring Campaigns:\nReachability for the filter list is calculated at the pre-execution stage.\nReachability computation\nThe audience reachability is computed based on the whitelisting (valid mobile or email IDs) and their subscription status. For WhatsApp, the customers who have unsubscribed to a particular brand on WhatsApp are excluded and if the WhatsApp number is not available, the fall back channel will be considered. If a user's subscription status is not available, they are considered available.\n📘\nNote\nIf a customer has experienced more than three hard bounces in previous communication attempts, the system automatically blocks future messages to that customer to prevent repeated delivery failures.\nUpdated\nabout 3 hours ago\nTable of Contents\nReachability Categories\nWhen is Reachability Calculated?\nReachability computation"

Click\n+Add Label\nto use appropriate dynamic tags in your message. You can also use Liquid language in the messages.\nIf you want to include special characters in your message content, select the\nAllow Unicode characters\ncheckbox.\nPreview or Test messages to ensure the format of the message is as intended.\nPreview\n: You can see the message of how it is sent to recipients. Check if the text and formatting are as intended.\nTest message\n: You can send a text message to a test group for review by adding mobile numbers, email ids, or test user groups. If required, you can enable the support for Liquid language to send personalised messages, messages based on conditions, product recommendations based on last purchase, etc. For more information, refer to the detailed\ndocumentation on Liquid language\n.\nThe virtual screen of a mobile phone displays the words as you type them. As you start typing text. You can also see the number of characters entered.\nClick\nSave\n.\n📘\nYou can see a sample view of your message on the right panel.\nOptout tag is compulsory to include. To know more about each tag, see the\nMessage content section\n.\nEnable link tracking for SMS\nTo understand the usage of links sent out through SMS campaigns, tracking of links in SMS is essential. Link tracking lets orgs capture metrics that state how many users have clicked on a link sent in SMS and the total number of clicks on a link.\nLink tracking is not enabled by default. You need to create a ticket assigning it to the Capillary support team.\nDue to the DLT compliance restrictions in India, you need to add the link through a variable tag only so that the whitelisted template does not get affected.\nOnce enabled, you can insert the link in SMS using the respective variable tag\n{#var#}\n.\nThis is applicable for\nOne-time SMS campaign\nRecurring SMS campaign\nCoupon expiry reminders and messages resend\n📘\nAdding links outside the {#var#} tag will result in the template mismatch leading to delivery failure.\nThe system replaces the mentioned link with an internal tiny URL. The link added by the user would be transformed.\nFor example, if the link is\nwww.google.com\n, it could be changed to s.cplry.com/7383936D89.\nChanging the link would also affect the characters of the SMS script.\nFor example, if the replaced link is 20-22 characters in length, the SMS character count can be changed by 15 characters (either add or remove).\nTrack SMS links on Insights+\nOnce the SMS is sent, you can track the link metrics using Insights+ as explained in the following.\nLog on to InTouch navigate to Menu >\nInsights+\n.\nNavigate to the report that you want to track.\nFor your chart, you will be able to track the following metrics of SMS links.\nUnique Click Count\n- Get the number of unique clicks on the link.\nTotal Click Count\n- Get the number of total clicks on the link.\nAdd a communication channel, if required, as a dimension to get data for each communication channel.\nUpdated\n6 months ago\nTable of Contents\nAdd SMS Content\nEnable link tracking for SMS\nTrack SMS links on Insights+"

Templates that do not align clearly with the specified template type are more likely to be rejected by WhatsApp during the template approval process.\nTransactional:\nShare account updates, order updates, alerts and more to share important information.\nMarketing:\nSend promotional offers, product announcements, and more to increase engagement and awareness\nOTP:\nIt allows you to alert your customers about various updates like shipping, ticket and transportation, reservation, etc.\nIn the\nMessage language\n, select the desired language.\nIn the\nMedia\n, select the type of media. The template supports text, images, video and documents\nFor sending a message, select\nText\n, and type a relevant message that you want to send. The message content should be as per the template category.\nHeader and footer in messages: You can use the header and footer message option to keep the conversation engaging. For example, if you set the header \"Hi {{firstname}}\" and footer \"Get well soon\", the message appears as shown in the below figure:\nNote:\nAs per the Meta policy, you can add a maximum of one variable for the header. For the footer there is no variable option.\nQuick reply in messages - You can add quick reply to send pre-defined responses or actions with a single tap. This helps to get more number of responses and saves time for the user.\nCustom tags in messages: Whatsapp does not support custom tags. If you want to use custom tags in the template, replace tag names with numeric values in sequential order. Once the template is approved, you can replace numeric values with the actual tags before sending.\nFor example, If your message is: Hi {{firstname}}, here is your voucher {{voucher_code}} for our EOSS.\nYou need to send it as: Hi {{1}}, here is your voucher {{2}} for our EOSS.\nAdd links in your template: You may send URLs in a template. For example, “Thanks for registering with Demo Business. To continue, click on\nhttps://app.example.com”\n. For recipients to see the preview of the link in the message, you need to have an Official WhatsApp Business Account.\nFor sending images, videos or documents, select the desired option and upload the file. You can also drag and drop the file.\n📘\nYou can select the content language provided by WhatsApp. However, currently, this is restricted to English. Other languages will be allowed in the future.\nClick on\nSend for approval\n.\nCapillary then sends the template to WhatsApp for approval. You can check the status of the template:\nAwaiting Approval: The template is under review and yet to be approved by WhatsApp as per their norms. (Orange dot)\nApproved: The template has been approved successfully. You can start using approved templates.  (Green dot)\nRejected: The template is not approved. Check if the template is as per the WhatsApp guidelines. Modify the template accordingly and send it for approval again. (Red dot)\nUpdated\n6 months ago"

These tags allow you to insert specific information, such as a recipient's name, store name, or other relevant details, into the message. For example, you might use a label like\n{{first_name}}\nto include the recipient's name in each message.\nCoupon start and end date\nCoupons or offers have varying start and end dates for each customer based on their interactions with the brand. To provide information to customers regarding their offers' start and end dates, you can use these tags and send communications.\nExample:\nConsider two users: David and Roy. David receives an offer assigned on January 1st, with redemption starting on January 7th and ending on January 10th. Roy, on the other hand, is assigned an offer on January 11th, with start and end dates of January 17th and January 20th, respectively. If you want to send an SMS to remind them about their coupons' validity periods, you can use the coupon expiry and coupon start date tags in the message content.\nEntry event\nYou can use the entry event label (dynamic tag) in a journey to include the values associated with the user's entry event in your communication message. The available tags depend on the entry trigger. For example, if the user entry event is based on a promotion, you can include details such as the promotion name or promotion start date in the message. To add this, select the Entry Event option from the drop-down menu and choose the appropriate label tag.\nIf the entry event is changed after using the entry event label, a warning message is displayed. If the warning is ignored, the labels will fail to function correctly.\nUpdated\n4 months ago\nTable of Contents\nCoupon start and end date\nEntry event"

It lets you personalize your messages based on user data, making your communications more relevant and engaging. For instance, you can use liquid language to define the date format according to the customer's locale, send product recommendations based on the customer's interest, etc.\n📘\nNote\nBy default, the Liquid language is not enabled. You need to raise a Jira ticket to the sustenance team and enable the LiquidFeature config.\nBasic Syntax\nLiquid uses two types of markup:\nOutput markup (denoted by {{ }}): Used to output content.\nTag markup (denoted by {% %}): Used for logic and control flow.\nVariables\nVariables allow you to insert dynamic content into your templates. Common variables might include:\n{{ customer.first_name }}\n: The customer's first name\n{{ customer.email }}\n: The customer's email address\n{{ customer.total_purchases }}\n: The total number of purchases made by the customer\nUsage example:\nLiquid\nHello {{ customer.first_name }},\nVariable Formatting\nFormatting modify the output of Liquid objects. They are used with the pipe character ( | ).\nCommon filters include:\ncapitalize\n: Capitalizes the first letter of a string\ndowncase\n: Converts a string to lowercase\nupcase\n: Converts a string to uppercase\ndate\n: Formats a date (see\nDate Formatting\nsection)\nmoney\n: Formats a number as currency (see\nCurrency Formatting\nsection)\nUsage example:\nLiquid\nWelcome back, {{ customer.first_name | capitalize }}!\nYour last purchase was on {{ customer.last_purchase_date | date: \"%B %d, %Y\" }}.\nControl Flow\nControl flow tags create conditions that decide whether blocks of Liquid code should be executed.\nCommon control flow tags:\nif\n,\nelsif\n,\nelse\n: Conditional statements\nunless\n: Negative conditional statement\nUsage example:\nLiquid\n{% if customer.vip_status == true %}\n  Enjoy your exclusive VIP offer!\n{% elsif customer.total_purchases > 5 %}\n  Thanks for being a loyal customer!\n{% else %}\n  Check out our latest products!\n{% endif %}\nDate Formatting\nDates can be formatted using the\ndate\nfilter. Here are some common format specifiers:\n%B\n: Full month name (e.g., \"January\")\n%b\n: Abbreviated month name (e.g., \"Jan\")\n%d\n: Day of the month, zero-padded (01-31)\n%e\n: Day of the month (1-31)\n%Y\n: Four-digit year (e.g., 2024)\n%y\n: Two-digit year (e.g., 24)\n%H\n: Hour in 24-hour format (00-23)\n%I\n: Hour in 12-hour format (01-12)\n%M\n: Minute (00-59)\n%S\n: Second (00-59)\n%p\n: AM/PM\nExample:\nLiquid\n{{ order_date | date: \"%B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p\" }}\nThis might output: \"September 26, 2024 at 02:30 PM\"\nLocale-Specific Date Formatting\nFor international audiences, you may need to format dates according to specific locales here are some common approaches:\nLocale parameter in date filter:\nLiquid\n{{ order_date | date: \"%B %d, %Y\", locale: \"fr\" }}\nLocalize (\nl\n) or translate (\nt\n) filters:\nLiquid\n{{ order_date | l: \"date.formats.long\" }}\nSystem-wide locale setting:\nLiquid\n{{ order_date | date: \"long\" }}\nLocale-aware time zones:\nLiquid\n{{ event_date | date: \"%B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p %Z\", locale: \"de\" }}\nCurrency Formatting\nLiquid typically provides filters for formatting monetary values according to different currencies and locales.\nCommon currency filters include:\nmoney\n: Formats a number as currency\nmoney_with_currency\n: Formats a number as currency and includes the currency symbol or code\nUsage examples:\nBasic currency formatting:\nLiquid\n{{ product.price | money }}\nThis might output: \"$10.00\"\nCurrency formatting with symbol:\nLiquid\n{{ product.price | money_with_currency }}\nThis might output: \"$10.00 USD\"\nLocale-specific currency formatting:\nLiquid\n{{ product.price | money: locale: \"fr\" }}\nThis might output: \"10,00 €\"\nSpecifying a different currency:\nLiquid\n{{ product.price | money: currency: \"EUR\" }}\nThis might output: \"€10.00\"\nCombining locale and currency:\nLiquid\n{{ product.price | money_with_currency: currency: \"JPY\", locale: \"ja\" }}\nThis might output: \"¥1,000 JPY\"\nLoops\nLoops are used to iterate over collections like arrays or hashes.\nCommon loop tags:\nfor\n: Iterate over an array\nbreak\n: Exit a loop\ncontinue\n: Skip the current iteration\nUsage example:\nLiquid\nYour recent purchases:\n{% for product in customer.recent_purchases limit:3 %}\n  - {{ product.name }}\n{% endfor %}\nBest Practices\nAlways test your templates with sample data before sending.\nUse meaningful variable names for clarity.\nImplement fallback content for missing data:\nLiquid\n{{ customer.first_name | default: \"Valued Customer\" }}\nKeep your templates simple and readable.\nUse comments to explain complex logic:\nLiquid\n{% comment %}Check if customer is eligible for discount{% endcomment %}\nBe mindful of different locales when formatting dates and currencies.\nUse appropriate error handling to prevent broken personalization:\nLiquid\n{% if customer.first_name %}Hello {{ customer.first_name }}{% else %}Hello there{% endif %}\nExamples\nPersonalized Email Greeting:\nLiquid\nDear {{ customer.first_name | default: \"Valued Customer\" }},\nConditional Content based on Purchase History:\nLiquid\n{% if customer.total_purchases > 10 %}\n  As a loyal customer, enjoy 20% off your next purchase!\n{% elsif customer.total_purchases > 5 %}\n  Thanks for your continued support. Here's 10% off your next order!\n{% else %}\n  Shop now and start earning rewards!\n{% endif %}\nProduct Recommendations with Price:\nLiquid\nBased on your interests, we recommend:\n{% for product in recommended_products limit:3 %}\n  - {{ product.name }}: {{ product.price | money_with_currency }}\n{% endfor %}\nAbandoned Cart Reminder with Total:\nLiquid\n{% if customer.abandoned_cart %}\n  Don't forget about the items in your cart:\n  {% for item in customer.abandoned_cart.items %}\n    - {{ item.name }}: {{ item.price | money }}\n  {% endfor %}\n  Total: {{ customer.abandoned_cart.total | money_with_currency }}\n{% endif %}\nEvent Countdown with Localized Date:\nLiquid\n{% assign days_until_event = event_date | date: \"%s\" | minus: \"now\" | date: \"%s\" | divided_by: 86400 %}\nOnly {{ days_until_event }} days until our big sale!\nMark your calendar: {{ event_date | date: \"long\", locale: customer.locale }}\nInternational Pricing:\nLiquid\nOur new product is now available!\nPrice in your region: {{ product.price | money_with_currency: locale: customer.locale }}\nUpdated\n6 months ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction to Liquid\nBasic Syntax\nVariables\nVariable Formatting\nControl Flow\nDate Formatting\nLocale-Specific Date Formatting\nCurrency Formatting\nLoops\nBest Practices\nExamples"

Employees are grouped under their respective child organizations and access the WellCo mobile application.\nWellCo organizes company-wide challenges and missions to encourage healthy habits among employees. Communications for these activities—such as emails—are primarily sent from the parent organization. However, each employer organization has its own unique branding requirements, including specific logos, colors, headers, and footers, which must be reflected in the communications sent to their employees.\nFor example:\nWellCo-Branded Communication\n: Emails sent under WellCo’s branding display its corporate logo, colors, and header/footer design.\nEmployer-Specific Communication\n: Emails sent to employees of specific organizations (e.g., Company Alpha) display their unique branding, such as a distinct logo, color scheme, and header/footer elements.\nTo address this, organization-level custom fields can be created and used in the email templates to dynamically personalize the content.\nCreating Dynamic Content\nTo create dynamic headers, footers, or other personalized content in your emails, follow these steps:\nCreate the required custom fields using API\n:\nThese custom fields hold organization-specific information, such as logo, branding color, or company name. Since these APIs are internal, you must contact the Capillary Product Support team to configure and create these fields.\nConfigure the email template\n:\nWhile setting up the email template, navigate to the\nLabels\nsection and select\nOrganization Custom Fields\n. Choose the relevant fields to include dynamic content in your email.\nFor example:\nTo display the employer’s brand name in the header, select the custom field for\nBrand Name\n.\nTo apply organization-specific branding colors, use the respective custom field for\nBrand Color\n.\nWhen the communication is sent, the platform automatically adjusts the email content—such as headers, footers, and other elements—based on the organization’s branding.\n🚧\nNote\nMake sure that there are no error in the custom field created, else the tags can cause error in the email.\nUpdated\n3 months ago\nTable of Contents\nUse Case\nCreating Dynamic Content"

These can also be used as Influencer Codes. You can issue promo codes to either your loyalty or anonymous customers via partner or physical coupons. This helps in improving engagement and acquisition.\nPromo codes can be used by anyone who has the code during the time of checkout to avail the benefits based on code validations. You can link any type of promotion to the code like combo promotions, fixed amount, percentage based discounts, free product, or bundled pricing.\nCode linked promotions are generally distributed directly in the stores or through email campaigns. Both can be availed by customers either at in-store or e-commerce websites through their coalition partners depending on their validity.\nA code can be only used once and is unique for each customer.\nPromo codes become invalid when the promotion expires.\nPromo codes are applicable to both loyalty and non-loyalty customers.\nPromo codes can be redeemed multiple times as per the configuration set.\nUse Case 1\n: Number of transactions across which the code can be redeemed.\nExample\n: For a promotion X is created,  you can restrict the redemption for up to 10 transactions.\nUse case 2\n: Limit the maximum discount across redemptions.\nExample\n: There is a promotion with code to provide 10% off on every transaction a customer makes, limit max discount across redemptions to 1000.\nCustomer can continue redeeming the code n number time till the discount disbursed does not cross 1000.\nUse Case 3\n: Handle trending Influencer Marketing successfully through these promotion restrictions. Brands can promote themselves on various social media platforms through influencers, who can further gift these promo codes to customers. Brands can enable a limit on the number of times a promo code can be used, limit number of transactions a promo code can allow etc.\nExample\n: Mansi is an Instagram influencer. Brand provides her with a code called HOLIMAN100. She can share the promo code with her followers. The brand can limit the redemptions count to 1000.\nSo the first 1000 users to use this code will get the benefit.\nTo know how to configure, see Code linked promotion under Create Promotion.\nEarned Promotions\nThe filter will target the audience who earned promotions during a specific period.\nExample\n:  Filter users who have earned promotions more than 3 times in July month.\nConsider Zoha has earned 2 promotions on July 7, and 3 promotions on July 10, and Raj has earned 1 promotion on July 10.\nWho will make it to the filter list? - Zoha; As we want a user who has earned more than 3 promotions in the selected time range.\nCreate promotions\nTo create each type of promotion, see the following section.

For this, they would want to keep the same promotion name every time they run this promotion.\nAnother case could be launching independence day promotion every year, for this also, they would want to keep the same promotion name.\nHence to support the brands, a new update is introduced:\nUsers can use the expired or disabled promotion names in cart promotions\nUsers can update an existing promotion to use the same name\nThis update eliminates the need to create new names for promotions with similar offers, saving valuable time and effort for marketing teams.\nDifferentiation between promotions can be achieved through unique Promotion IDs and promotion duration.\nIn\nPromotion description\n, enter a brief description of the promotion.\nIn\nPromotion duration\n, set the start date and end date of the promotion using the calendar boxes.\nIn\nPromotion type\n, choose the desired promotion type.\nEnable\nIssue promotion in deactivated state\nto allow customers to manually activate the promotion to auto-apply for a transaction.

This led to customers getting benefits beyond the allowed number of redemptions.\nIn a typical cart promotion related transaction, below is the sequence of events :\nCustomer makes the purchase and goes for checkout\nThe cashier adds the items to the cart and checks for applicable offers\nCart promotions returns the applicable offers (At this point promotions are not redeemed but merely evaluated for the cart and is indicative of the benefits)\nCashier applies the offers and proceeds for payment (Customer has received the benefit hence Capillary cannot reject any redemption)\nCapillary receives the transaction (via transactionAdd API)\nThe transactionAdd API internally calls the cart promotions module to redeem the promotions and update the redemption KPIs . Here two scenarios could arise,\nRedemption identifier is valid and irrespective of the breach in KPI we record the redemption.\nRedemption identifier is invalid. Currently these are rejected by the cart promotions module\nWith step 4 & 6 being asynchronous, it leads to a potential loophole where the promotion benefit has been given to the customer but the corresponding redemption has not happened in the cart promotions\nTo avoid this, whenever such a scenario arises, a cart locking feature is triggered internally.\nFor every cart identifier, we compute the promotion redemption KPIs at both customer and promotion level. These computations are transient or temporary in nature and block the usage of the promotion(s) for new cart identifiers. In the evaluate payload, a unique cart identifier to be sent by cart promotions\nPOS will echo the same identifier for the ongoing transaction if a second evaluate/getOffers call is made to cart promotions\nFor the same cart identifier, if a new request is received for the same customer the transient values will be reversed and cart to be evaluated as new\nOnce the transaction is received, the transient values are marked as permanent.\nIn case the transaction is cancelled or timeout, the transient state can be released bythe  below methods\nExternal - API call with the same cart identifier.\nTime based trigger -Brand can set up a default time to release the lock in case the external trigger is not received\nAs a brand,you can/want to see the active cart evaluation & disable the locking of the applied promotions/earn instances once they are in the transient state so that it does not lead to conflicts later\nOnce the Cashier starts the txn ,POS sends the getOffers call\nSystems locks the offers & updates the KPIs\nIf customer tries to toggle on/off, system disables the activate/deactivate action in below manner\nFor mode=discount the failure to happen at promotionId level\nFor mode=payment vouchers the failure to happen at earnid level\nEither the customer is on offers screen OR customer opens the app and goes to offers screen\nMobile app makes a getCustomerPromotions call AND\nCart promotions sends the customer promotions along with temp redemptions and cart details\nCustomer sees the cart in progress and disabled offers\naddTxn is delayed\nCustomers will see the offers in a locked state. Now the only recourse is to either wait OR Contact customer support OR Offers auto unlock after 24 hrs\nImage 1: Evaluation log of the cart, option to release the cart\nImage 2: Cart discarded/released\nExample\nOffer configuration\nOffer : Purchase items worth 1000 and get a buy 1 get 1 on coke\nBelow are the redemption, discount and transaction restrictions at earn level\nmax\nusage\nearn restrictions\nredemption\n5\n0\ndiscount\n300\n0\ntransaction\n1\n0\nBelow are the cart/event level restriction\ncart/event level\n1\n0\nAssuming customer has made 1 transaction worth 1000 and earned the offer\nSo customer has,\nE1\nmax\nredemption\n5\ndiscount\n300\ntransaction\n1\nNow customer goes for the transaction where he/she wants to redeem the coke offer\nStep 1\nCart >> Customer purchased a coke worth Rs.100\nqty\nrate\namount\ncart\ncoke\n1\n100\n100\nStep 2\nCashier scans the items and makes the /evaluate call to get the cart promotions applicable on the cart\nInternally since customer has two earns, below temp redemptions will be recorded\nEarn 1 >> temporary redemptions take place and offer is locked\nmax\nusage\ntemp redemption\nearn restrictions\nredemption\n5\n0\n1\ndiscount\n300\n0\n100\ntransaction\n1\n0\n1\ncart/event level\n1\n0\n1\nStep 3 -> Preventing accidental & fraud transaction\nNow if another transaction comes for the customer, this offer will not be applied since the max transaction level limit is hit.

You can create coupons in one place and use them across various services—whether internal services like campaigns and loyalty programs or external services through third-party integrations. Once one service utilises an offer, it becomes unavailable to others. This tool is solely for creating offers with coupon codes; you will need to use other services to send the coupon codes to customers\nKey features of CMS:\nPersonalised Coupons\n: Create customised coupons tailored to specific needs.\nExpiry Settings:\nSet coupon expiry either on a fixed date or based on the validity of a targeted campaign.\nAssociation:\nLink coupons to specific products or organisational units (OUs).\nCoupon Generation:\nChoose to generate coupon codes automatically or upload them manually.\nCustomer Targeting:\nAssociate coupons with particular sets of customers.\nDiscount Types:\nCreate either percentage-based or flat discount coupons.\nIssuance Limits:\nLimit the number of coupons issued per customer or promotion.\nRedemption Restrictions:\nRestrict coupon use based on parameters such as transaction amount, date, and time.\nExpiry Notifications:\nAutomate reminders and notifications for expiring coupons.\nDashboard\n: Access a dashboard to view coupon details including creation and expiry dates, usage by different services (e.g., Loyalty, Outbound, Timeline), and redemption counts.\nPerformance Tracking:\nMonitor coupon performance and redemption rates to refine marketing strategies.\nTypes Of Offer\nFixed amount\n: This will allow the user to avail of the mentioned discount amount on any selected product.\nPercentage-based\n: This will allow the user to avail mentioned discount percentage on any selected product.\nUpdated\n6 months ago\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nKey features of CMS:\nTypes Of Offer"

This works for coupons issued through Capillary, using any of these methods:\nAutomatically create unique codes\nGive a common code to all coupons\nUpload existing coupon codes\nYou can add customers when you\ncreate an offer\nor by navigating to\nEngage+\n>\nIncentive\n>\nMore Options\nunder the offer name >\nUpload customers\n.\nBelow is the screenshot of a sample file to upload multiple coupons for a customer\nError scenarios when issuing multiple coupons to a customer\nYou may encounter errors when issuing multiple coupon codes to a customer in the following cases:\nInvalid customer identifier, such as email ID, mobile number, external ID, or user ID.\nBelow are the screenshots of the error messages for different invalid customer identifiers when uploading existing coupon codes.\nAn error message indicating an invalid UserID\nAn error message indicating an invalid email ID\nAn error message indicating an invalid mobile number\nAn error message indicating an invalid external ID\nExceed the maximum coupon issuance limit per customer\nExample scenario\n: Consider the following:\nSeries type: DiscCode\nMaximum issual limit per customer: 3\nMinimum gap between two issual: No gap\nMaximum issual limit for series: No limit\nPerform the following steps:\nUpload a file containing four entries for the same UserID.\nRe-upload the same file without any changes.\nUpload the same file again, but include only one entry for the UserID.\nAn error message indicating exceeding the maximum coupon limit per customer\nIssue a coupon before meeting the minimum gap requirement\nExample scenario\n: Consider the following:\nSeries type: DiscCode\nMaximum issual limit per customer: 3\nMinimum gap between two issuals: 1 day\nMaximum issual limit for series: No limit\nPerform the following:\nUpload a file containing four entries for the same UserID.\nAn error message indicating the minimum gap requirement not being met\nExceed the maximum issuance limit for the series\nExample scenario\n: Consider the following:\nSeries Type : DiscCode\nMaximum issual limit per customer: No limit\nMinimum gap between two issual: No gap\nMaximum issual limit for series: 2\nPerform the following:\nUpload a file containing four entries for the same UserID.\nAn error message indicating the maximum issuance limit for the series exceeded\nIssue more than one generic coupon to a customer\nExample scenario\n: Consider the following:\nSeries Type : Generic\nMaximum issual limit per customer: Not Applicable\nMinimum gap between two issual: Not Applicable\nMaximum issual limit for series: Not Applicable\nPerform the following steps:\nUpload a file containing four entries for the same UserID.\nUpload the same file again.\nAn error message indicating more than one generic coupon to a customer\nChecking the status of coupon upload\nAfter uploading the CSV file to issue coupons, you can check the upload status by going to\nEngage+\n>\nIncentive\n>\nMore Options\nunder the offer name >\nUpload customers\n.\nIn case of failures, click on\nDownload Issues\nto view the error details from the\nUpload customer\nscreen.\nConfiguring the Issual & Reminder Details\nYou can manage how coupons are issued and tracked and also restrict customers based on past\nissuals, max issuals per customer\netc...To set this up, follow these steps:\nEnable\n“Restrict based on past coupon issuals\n”  so that you can prevent customers from receiving coupons they've already used in the past 6 months and Select the offer from the past 6 months from the drop-down. The selected coupons will not be sent to the customers who have received these coupons in the past 6 months.\nEnable “\nmaximum issuals per customer\n” to set the maximum number of coupons to be issued to each customer and the minimum gap (number of days) between two consecutive coupon issues and Enter the maximum number of coupons a customer can receive. If you do not want to set a limit, choose “\nNo Limit.\n\"\nSelect\nIf a customer matches the criteria again\n.\nSelect\nSend existing valid coupon\nto send the same coupon again.\nSelect\nDo not send any coupon\nto ignore sending any coupon.\nEnable “\nlimit total issuals from the offer?\n” and enter the number of limits that you can restrict the maximum coupon to be issued in an offer and configure notifications and then Enable “\nsend notification for issual limit\n” and enter the number of remaining coupons that should trigger the notification.\nYou can notify brand POCs when the coupon issual limit is about to reach a certain threshold value. The notification is sent to the brand POCs through email.\nEnable “\nsms content for resending the coupon\n” to resend coupons via SMS if a customer missed them. Use predefined Tags wherever necessary. If the message has Unicode characters, check Allow Unicode characters.\nExample: If a customer missed a coupon and requested an executive to resend it. The executive can resend the coupon if this option is enabled.\nEnable “\nSend expiry reminders”\nto create multiple coupon expiry reminders and send them to customers through SMS/Email. Then Set the number of days before which message is to be sent, the message channel and the specific time. Similarly, you can add multiple reminders using the\n+Reminder\noption.\nConfiguring the Redemption settings\nTo configure various redemption limits and rules for how and when coupons can be redeemed, perform the following :\nEnable\nCoupon can be shared and redeemed by anyone\nto allow redemption of a coupon by anyone, for example friends and family. You can limit the number of times the coupon is redeemed. This additionally also gives access to set limits on\nCoupon code limit\n.\nConfigure the coupon code limits under\nCoupon code limit, Individual customer limit\nand\nAcross customer limit.\nCoupon code limit\n- The 'coupon code limit' feature allows brands to set a maximum number of times a specific coupon code can be redeemed across all customers. This ensures that once the set limit is reached, the code can no longer be used, regardless of how many different customers attempt to redeem it.\nUSECASE: A brand runs a promotion using the coupon code \"SUMMER50\", offering a 50% discount. Without a coupon code limit, an unlimited number of customers could redeem the code, potentially leading to higher-than-expected discounts.\nBy setting a coupon code limit of 1,000 redemptions, the brand ensures that only the first 1,000 customers can use the code. Once the limit is reached, the code becomes invalid, preventing excessive discount usage.\nIndividual customer limit\n- The 'Individual customer limit' feature allows brands to set the maximum number of times a single customer can redeem a specific coupon code. Once a customer reaches their redemption limit, they cannot use the code again, even if the coupon is still available for other customers.\nUSECASE 1: A brand offers a \"WELCOME10\" coupon that gives a 10% discount on purchases. To prevent misuse, they set the Individual customer limit to 1.\nThis ensures that each customer can only use the coupon once, even though the code may still be available for others. This helps the brand maintain the promotion’s intended purpose—rewarding new customers without allowing repeated use by the same person.\nUSECASE 2: In the case of the Step Function, the limit should be set to no limit because the number of coupons issued depends on the transaction amount and cannot be predetermined. However, the redemption limit can be set depending on how many times a particular issued coupon can be redeemed. To know more about Step Function, click\nhere\n.\nAcross customer limit\n-\nThe 'Across customer limit' feature controls the total number of redemptions allowed across all coupon codes within a specific series. This ensures that once the predefined limit is reached, no additional redemptions can occur, even if individual codes or customers still have remaining redemption allowances.\nThis is particularly useful for large-scale promotions where multiple codes are distributed but the brand wants to cap the overall number of discounts given out. It provides a way to manage total redemptions across a campaign while still allowing flexibility at the individual coupon and customer levels.\nUSECASE: A brand launches a holiday sale where they distribute 5,000 unique coupon codes, each offering a discount.\nTo control the total discount given, they set a Series-Level Limit of 50,000 redemptions. This means that even though each individual code may have its own redemption limit, once the total redemptions across all codes in the series reach 50,000, no further redemptions will be allowed.\nThis helps the brand manage the overall budget for the promotion while still allowing multiple customers to redeem different codes.\nThe redemption limit settings are as follows:\nField\nDescription\nLimit to\nSet the maximum number of times a coupon code can be redeemed to a certain number.\nNo limit\nAllows unlimited redemptions for a coupon code\nS. No\nCoupon Series Type\nAllow anyone to redeem it?\nCode-Level Limit\nCustomer-Level Limit\nSeries-Level Limit\nExample\n1\nAutomatically Generated\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nA new year sale where a generated code \"NY2024\" can be redeemed 10 times in total, but can be redeemed only once per customer.

In  Limit to, enter the maximum number of times the coupon can be redeemed by a customer.\nIn  “\nStores allowing redemption\n” You can restrict an offer to be redeemed at specific stores by selecting the stores or uploading a list of stores. Select\ntills/stores/concepts/ zones\nFrom the “\nRestrict stores allowing redemptions\n“section. By default, an offer is available for redemption at any store.\nChoose Upload CSV file to upload a file containing the IDs of your preferred zones/stores/concepts.\nChoose Select Values to select your preferred zones/stores/concepts from the list directly. Till -> fetches the series for the till IDs, Store -> fetches for that individual store, Zone -> fetches the series mapped to zone, Concept -> fetches for the series mapped to concept.\nIn\nBill Amount that can redeem the coupon\nYou can restrict the minimum and maximum bill amount criteria for offer eligibility that Enable “\nMinimum bill amount”\nenter the minimum amount and Enable\n“Maximum bill amount\n” and enter the maximum amount. The coupon can be redeemed only if your bill amount is under the limitation.\nIn\nDays & time when the coupon can be redeemed\nYou can set a specific day, date, and time slot for the coupon to be redeemed by selecting the following:\nDays of the week\n- To allow redemption on selected days of the week- Sunday to Saturday.\nDays of the month\n- To allow redemption on selected days of a month - 1st - 31st.\nHours of the day\n- To allow redemption in the preferred hours of the day.\nIn\nRequire gap between the redemption of a customer\nYou can set a minimum gap (number of days) between two consecutive redemptions. For that Enable “\nRequire gap between redemptions of a customer\n” and Enter minimum days between redemption.\nNote: This option is not applicable if the coupon is restricted to redeemed only once.\nIn\nLimit total redemption in the offer\nYou can limit the maximum number of coupon redemption in an offer and set the maximum allowed coupon redemption number.

Create a CSV file with identifiers of customers whose coupons you want to expire, and upload the file using Upload Customer.\nCheck\nI understand that revoking coupons will make them unredeemable\n. Expired coupons cannot be redeemed or reversed.\nClick\nRevoke\n.\nA message is shown that the customer data is successfully uploaded. All the coupons issued to the selected customer are revoked and ready for use.\nNotes: You cannot revoke redeemed coupons. If a customer has multiple active coupons from the same series, then all active coupons are revoked.\nTransfer of Coupon\nYou can revoke the coupon and then assign the same coupon code to the intended customer through coupon upload, as transferring a coupon from one customer to another customer is not supported.\nPersonalization of coupon at scale\nPersonalization of coupon at scale (audience of 20M+) : This is a limited release and is enabled as an add-on. This is not a part of any standard package. Please reach out to your CSM to enable the personalization of the coupon feature.\nTo create this follow the steps:\nNavigate to the\nEngage +\nmodule and click on\nIncentives\n.\nClick on*\nCreate Offer*\n.\nEnter the basic details of the coupon series like\noffer name, offer expiry, discount value for each coupon(fixed/percentage), products applicable\netc.\nWhile selecting how to generate coupon codes for the series :\nSelect\nThrough capillary.\nClick on\nGenerate common codes(s) -> Generate randomized common code(s).\nEnter the sample common code, it could be numeric or alphanumeric.\nHere, in this case, TEST12345 is just a sample code to generate the randomized codes from this reference.\nThe system will take the length of the sample code provided and if it is numeric or alphanumeric and then generate the random codes based on this input.\nThe resulting codes will be of the same length and will have 50% of the code as fixed for all the codes, i.e. in this case, let’s say TEST will be fixed and the remaining 5 digits will be randomly generated.\nThe fixed part will be unique in the backend for an org.\nNote: Min 5 characters should be there in the sample code and Max. of 10 characters is supported.\nOnce the offer is created, the sample code provided at the time of creation can’t be changed and in the UI, in edit flow, it won’t be the same code which was provided at the time of offer creation.\nThis option is only available when offers are created from the incentives section but can be claimed in any module.\nThis type of series can only be created via UI and not via coupon APIs.\nThe feature of uploading customers won’t be available for this type of coupon series.\nThis option is not available for offers created via campaign flow or loyalty flow.\nTime to issue 30M coupons via campaigns flows 3 hours.\nWith this feature, we can issue a maximum of 60 million unique coupons when 10-digit alphanumeric characters are used to create a coupon series.\nNote: The system allows for coupons to have multiple currencies and it is important to note that the coupon value will be converted to the store default currency at the time of transaction.\nTrack the reversal status of a coupon\nThis feature allows brands to easily indicate which coupons have been reversed and reinstated in the mobile app's user interface.\nThis will help customers to easily identify the coupon that was reversed, thus reducing confusion and the number of queries made to support.\nAdditionally, this feature will also improve the customer's experience by providing them with transparency and visibility into the status of their coupons.\nBrands can also use this feature to track and analyse the performance of their coupon campaigns and make data-driven decisions to optimise their rewards strategy.\nImpacted APIs :\nGet Customer Coupons\nGet Coupon details\nIn both the API response, isReversed and last_status_change_on values would be returning from the coupon_redemptions table based on the active and last_status_change_on columns.\nCoupon APIs\nIf you specify a zone in the API call, it will only return offers tagged to that zone, not to individual stores within it. For example, if a brand has stores A, B, and C in zone 1, using \"zone 1\" will only show offers for that zone, not for stores A, B, or C. To get offers for those specific stores, you need to include their store IDs in the API call.\nThe provided orgEntityIds won't be validated, meaning if an invalid ID is entered (not a proper store, zone, or concept ID), no error will be shown; instead, you simply won't receive any results for that ID.\nYou can only filter by one orgEntityType at a time in a single request.\nManage Store and Zone-Level Redemption Settings\nThis helps brands select & upload store names while creating a coupon series to restrict the coupon redemption to those stores. However, brands generally run scope restrictions based on store name.\nTo add store IDs for coupon series via Thrift,\nSaveCouponConfigRequest:  \n          CouponConfiguration:  \n                      redemptionOrgEntityDetails:  \n                                <orgEntityId\n                                redemptionOrgEntityType>,  \n                                <orgEntityId\n                                redemptionOrgEntityType>,\nAPI based implementation details,\nredemptionOrgEntityDetails is a list of redemptionOrgEntityType and orgEntityId.\nAdd redemptionOrgEntityType as STORE, ZONE or CONCEPT.\nAdd orgEntityId as a store, zone or concept id.\nThis is to be added in thrift SaveCouponConfigRequest to make a thrift call for saveCouponConfiguration.\nTo filter store IDs for coupon series via Thrift:\nAdd orgEntityType as STORE, ZONE or CONCEPT.\nAdd orgEntityIds with a list of store, zone or concept IDs.\nThis is to be added in thrift GetAllCouponConfigsRequest to make a thrift call for getAllCouponConfigurations.\n📘\nNote:\nRefer\ncoupon v1.1 APIs\nto issue coupon,Resend coupon,Redeem coupon etc..\nRefer\nCoupon v2 APIs\nto create coupon series, update coupon series etc...\nRefer\nCoupon Upload v1 APIs\nto upload coupon, upload redeem coupon etc...\nUpdated\n8 days ago\nTable of Contents\nCreate Coupons\nIssue Multiple Coupon Codes to a Customer\nChecking the status of coupon upload\nConfiguring the Issual & Reminder Details\nConfiguring the Redemption settings\nRevoke Coupon\nPersonalization of coupon at scale\nTrack the reversal status of a coupon\nCoupon APIs\nManage Store and Zone-Level Redemption Settings"

However, you can revoke the coupon and assign the same code to a new user by uploading the details.\nHow is the slab for points allocation determined—based on the new slab considering ongoing transactions, past transactions, or a combination of both?\nA: It depends on the configuration. Sometimes the slab upgrades after points are allocated, while other times it upgrades first, and then allocates the remaining points based on the new slab.\nCan the system generate QR codes for coupons?\nA: Yes, the system can generate QR codes for coupons. contact the Capillary support team to access this feature.\nHow do I apply a coupon to a transaction after it has been added to the system?\nA: If you want the coupon information to be reflected in the transaction, you must include the coupon details at the time of submitting the transaction.\nCan we cap the coupon discount at a customer level for coupons that allow multiple redemptions?\nA: No, this feature is not supported.\nIs it possible to find out which promotion issued a coupon through MemberCare?\nA: No, MemberCare does not provide specific details about which promotion issued a coupon. please contact capillary customer support for assistance.\nWhat values need to be adjusted in the Add Transaction API payload when redeeming a coupon?\nA:When redeeming a coupon, reduce the total bill and tender values by the coupon amount, and adjust each line item's amount to reflect the discount.\nAre there any ways to ingest coupon codes automatically if the coupon code is generated from POS?\nA: We offer integration via APIs if the series is already created. You can refer to the below documentation links\nhttps://capillary.github.io/api-documentation/#issue-coupon-to-customer-single\nhttps://capillary.github.io/api-documentation/#issue-coupons-to-customer-bulk\nhttps://capillary.github.io/api-documentation/#upload-coupons-batch\nCan we have more than one series per offer?\nA: Currently, our system supports only one series per offer. However, we have taken this as a feature request.\nDoes the system support 100 % as a discount value?\nA: Currently, the system accepts only 2-digit values (supporting up to 99%). But considering some special cases we came across yesterday, we will get this to 100%.\nCan I tag customers with auto-generated coupon codes?\nA: Yes, you can enable Issue to specific customers only in Coupons details and upload your customer list with any one of their identifiers (mobile no./email id, external ID, user ID). The auto-generated coupons are then tagged only to these customers.\nCan I configure the WeChat template for resending the coupon templates through POS?\nA: Currently, we support only the SMS template.\nHow can I see no. of uploaded coupons?\nA: When you upload coupons, you will see the uploaded count.

You can use a series ID, and Point of Sale (POS) identifier to consume an offer through an API call.\nWhat happens if the expiry date of an offer is after the campaign expiry date?\nA: After the expiry date of a campaign, the offer is still valid but in campaign reporting, you will get details only till the campaign end date.\nWhat if my coupon expiry is after my Offer expiry?\nA: If the expiry of the series is 31st Aug and the coupon code expiry is set as 3 days from issue. Now someone got the coupon on 31st Aug, then they can use it till 3rd Sept.\nDo we have test vs. control in Loyalty?\nA: No. We do not have a test vs. control check for the loyalty program.\nDo we need to reconfigure the loyalty program if we make any changes in the Offers tab of Loyalty?\nA: No, it is not required to reconfigure the loyalty program.\nWill there be any change in the isRedeemable get call nodes?\nA: We will add an additional node - Max Discount. Rest everything will remain the same.\nCan we have the same offer names?\nA: Yes, you can have duplicate offer names. But, it is highly recommended not to keep duplicate names, at least within a module.\nHow do you create coupons to be awarded on a member's birthday?\nA: To award birthday coupons, you can compile a list of members whose birthdays fall on the current date and launch a birthday campaign through Engage+, sending out coupons specifically to them.\n.

Select a start date and an end date for it.\nScheduling messages post audience sync confirmation\nYou can enable \"\nExecute message only after audience sync completion\n\" in the campaign message delivery setting and ensure that the campaign proceeds only after confirming the EI sync completion and verifying the audience refresh's up-to-date status.\nBy enabling this option, the system avoids disruptions caused by technical challenges that delay the EI sync and audience refresh.\nTo enable, perform the following:\nAfter you define and schedule the recurring period (repeats periodically) for the campaign messages, select the check box\nExecute message only after audience sync completion\n.\nIf required, select the check box\nWait for Sync completion until\nand define the time until which the system should wait for the audience sync. If the audience sync is not completed by this time, the recurring messages are sent without waiting for the audience sync. For instance, if you set this time as 9 pm, the system will wait until 9 pm for the sync to complete. If the sync is not completed by 9 pm, the campaign will execute regardless.\nThe recurring messages are not sent if you do not define a sync cut-off time and the audience sync is not completed.\nSetting an alert for recurring messages\nYou can set alerts for recurring messages in the campaign settings. For information, refer to the\ncampaign alert documentation\n.\nUpdated\n12 months ago\nTable of Contents\nImmediately after approval\nOn a specific date\nRepeat periodically\nScheduling messages post audience sync confirmation\nSetting an alert for recurring messages"

There are also orgs that run loyalty programs based on card series.  An org may also partner with various other companies and have different partner-loyalty programs with different partners.\nIn such instances, a customer could be part of one or more loyalty programs.\nEngage+ allows segmenting customers of a particular loyalty program and then targeting them by creating personalized communications. This will help you to drive KPIs such as cross-vertical sales, and boost average transaction value, and transaction frequency.\nA message consists of title, scope, and purpose. As you can create multiple messages for a campaign, it is recommended to use appropriate and different titles for each message for future references.\nTo create a new message, follow these steps.\nAdd a Message\nAdd audience\nAdd Creative\nAdd Incentive\nAdd schedule\nSend for approval\n📘\nThe scope selected while creating a new message is auto-applied to the filters.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago"

However, only campaigns that have a control group are considered in this computation. If a campaign does not have a control group (or if incremental sales are negative), the value for this KPI will be 0.\nIncremental Sales\n- Test only Campaigns - In campaigns where there is no Control group, a percentage of responder sales will be considered as incremental sales. This percentage value is currently 12% by default. However, you can modify the  percentage value in Insights+ (Library -> KPIs -> Incremental Sales - Test only Campaigns -> Edit).\n📘\nIf a campaign has a Control group, the value for this KPI will be 0.\nIncremental Sales\n- Variant - This KPI will give a sum of (1) and (2) mentioned above. You should use this directly for reporting incremental sales. However, you need to change the percentage of responder sales value (explained in (2) above) separately for this KPI. You can also change the name of the KPI for your org.\nView campaign summary report\nTo view the summary report of a campaign, follow these steps.\nOn the Engage+ home page, scroll down to the Campaign tab.\nSearch and select the campaign for which you want to see the report.\nReal-time open and click rates\n.\n(Open): The number of customers who have opened the email\n(Clicked): The number of unique customers that clicked on the link sent through email.\nScheduled Status\n: The current status of the scheduled campaign. Upcoming, Live, Ended, Completed.\nPerformance Target Base\n: The total number of targeted customers for the campaign message.\nContacted customers\n: The total number of customers reached through the campaign.\nContacted rate\n: The percentage ratio of the contacted customers to the targeted customers.\nDelivery rate\n: The percentage ratio of messages sent minus messages bounced to the total number of messages sent.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nCampaigns overall performance report\nView campaign summary report"

The configuration flow and options might vary for each promotion type.\nPromotion types\nLoyalty Promotion\nThese are general promotions to target customers for selected audiences with our AI-powered campaigns tools.  For example, get 20% off on Arrow shirts for customers who transacted in the last 90 days.\nUse case\n: Target customers who consume extra dark chocolates based on their preference and purchase history.\nExample\n: Get flat 60% off on extra dark chocolates between June 27, 2021, and July 10, 2021, at Store North Expressway 1 and 3.\nTo know how to configure, see\nLoyalty Promotions\nLoyalty earning promotion\nThe promotion is unlocked when customers complete a milestone or perform a loyalty activity (customer registration, profile update, and transaction).\nUse Case\n: Make customers realize the value of the data and offer incentives through promotions when they provide more details.\nExample\n: Get a flat 15% off on your purchase when you sign-up for email updates. The offer applies to the first 250 customers and each customer can avail the offer only once.\nThe offer is valid for stores only in the North Zone between  July 5, 2021, to July 31, 2021.\nTo know how to configure, see\nLoyalty Promotions\nLoyalty earning promotion]).\nPOS promotion\nThis is not specific to any audience group and anyone who makes transactions at POS can avail it. There is no need to broadcast these promotions to customers.\nUse Case\n: Promotion targeted at clearance of category Wafers. Such promotions are not broadcasted but configured at POS level. These are traditional promotions that run at POS and are not specific to loyalty or non-loyalty members.\nExample\n: All Wafers at $2.9, save $1.5, In-store every Saturday and Sunday between 10 AM- 6 PM in select stores: Store East 1, Store East 2, Store East 3, Store East 4, Store East 5. Offer Valid from Jun 27, 2021, - Jul 10, 2021. Also, the offer is valid on 1st Wafer of each transaction.\nTo know how to configure, see  POS promotion under Create Promotion.\nRewards promotion\nThese are promotions that customers can earn while making a purchase using reward points.\nUse Case\n: Customers can choose to exchange their reward points for cash, buy any promotion or product.\nExample\n: Redeem 2000 points and get a main grade fuel promotion worth $50. Offer valid till 31 July on select stations on specific fuel categories.\nTo know how to configure, see Rewards promotion under Create Promotion.\nCode linked promotion\nCode linked promotions are the physical coupon codes which all customers can redeem  irrespective of their loyalty status. These can also be used as Influencer Codes. You can issue promo codes to either your loyalty or anonymous customers via partner or physical coupons. This helps in improving engagement and acquisition.\nPromo codes can be used by anyone who has the code during the time of checkout to avail the benefits based on code validations. You can link any type of promotion to the code like combo promotions, fixed amount, percentage based discounts, free product, or bundled pricing.\nCode linked promotions are generally distributed directly in the stores or through email campaigns. Both can be availed by customers either at in-store or e-commerce websites through their coalition partners depending on their validity.\nA code can be only used once and is unique for each customer.\nPromo codes become invalid when the promotion expires.\nPromo codes are applicable to both loyalty and non-loyalty customers.\nPromo codes can be redeemed multiple times as per the configuration set.\nUse Case 1\n: Number of transactions across which the code can be redeemed.\nExample\n: For a promotion X is created,  you can restrict the redemption for up to 10 transactions.\nUse case 2\n: Limit the maximum discount across redemptions.\nExample\n: There is a promotion with code to provide 10% off on every transaction a customer makes, limit max discount across redemptions to 1000.\nCustomer can continue redeeming the code n number time till the discount disbursed does not cross 1000\nUse Case 3\n: Handle trending Influencer Marketing successfully through these promotion restrictions. Brands can promote themselves on various social media platforms through influencers, who can further gift these promo codes to customers. Brands can enable a limit on the number of times a promo code can be used, limit number of transactions a promo code can allow etc.\nExample\n: Mansi is an Instagram influencer. Brand provides her with a code called HOLIMAN100. She can share the promo code with her followers. The brand can limit the redemptions count to 1000.\nSo the first 1000 users to use this code will get the benefit.\nTo know how to configure, see Code linked promotion]() under Create Promotion.\nTo create each type of promotion, see the following section. The flow changes at Step 8 according to the type of promotion.\nCreate promotion\nThis section provides detailed instructions on how to configure each type of promotion. According to the type of promotion that you want to create,\nnavigate to the respective section after Step 7.\nYou can have an overall of 250 active promotions for an org (all types of promotions). However, it can be increased based on the requirement.\nTo create a cart or catalog promotion, follow these steps.\nOpen the campaign to add a promotion, navigate to the\nPromotions\ntab.\nClick\nCreate promotion\n.\nIn\nPromotion name\n, enter a name for the promotion.\nIn\nPromotion description\n, enter a brief description of the promotion.\nIn\nPromotion duration\n, set the start date and end date of the promotion using the calendar boxes.\nIn\nPromotion type\n, choose the desired promotion type.\nEnable Issue promotion in deactivated state to allow customers to manually activate the promotion to auto-apply for a transaction. For example, you can allow customers to activate 5% off on groceries. Whoever activates the offer will get flat 5% off on grocery items in their next transaction.\nThis is applicable only for\nLoyalty promotion, Loyalty earning promotion, and Rewards promotion.\nClick\nNext\nto continue.\nAccording to the type of promotion, configure other things and click\nCreate promotion\nto save.\nLoyalty promotion\nDefine qualifying cart conditions and benefits.\nAdd metadata in the promotion if required.\nLoyalty earning promotion\nConfigure promotion earning condition (activity or milestone-based).\nDefine qualifying cart conditions and benefits.\nAdd metadata in the promotion if required.\nConfigure promotion earning notifications and expiry reminders.\nPOS promotion\nDefine qualifying cart conditions and benefits.\nAdd metadata in the promotion if required.\nYou can link a subscription program through\npos promotion\nfor that,\nSelect\nAvailing conditions and benefits\n.\nSelect\nDefine scope and restrictions on availing promotions.\nClick on\nlimit to specific customers\nand choose the\nsupplementary program\n.\nRewards promotion\nConfigure promotion earning condition (Direct trigger)\nDefine qualifying cart conditions and benefits.\nAdd metadata in the promotion if required.\nConfigure promotion earning notifications and expiry reminders.\nAfter creating new reward promotion, you need to link the program to the org's Marvel rewards catalog.

For more details, click\nhere\n.\nCan we reach out to NDNC customers with a template with optout tag?\nReaching out to NDNC customers is directly handled by Telecom Operators - Airtel/ Vodafone, Jio etc. The customers are directly applying for NDNC to these operators. These are some extra settings for example customer can apply for NDNC but can wish to be reached out on certain days or time period. All this will be unknown to Capillary/ Gateway Partner/ Brand. So adding optout tag or not adding is irrelevant for NDNC. We can send entire customer list to operators and they can filter NDNC by their own. Screen reader support enabled.\nIn general practice users copy and paste the templates from vendor portal to excel where space issues may occur. How to handle this? Screen reader support enabled.\nWe can't handle space issues with static text. If space in coming in {#Var} field or just before or after it it will be taken as 1 character. It is advisable that the excel downloaded from DLT portal is uploaded directly to Engage+. Copy/ pasting templates in excel or manual creation of DLT template upload excel is not advisable as error can occur not only in Template content but Template id etc. as well. Screen reader support enabled.\nHow can I target NDNC users?\nNDNC targeting can happen as explained here. Suppose Person1 is NDNC customer. No brands can reach out to Person1 and this will be handled directly by Operators as Person1 would have applied for DND with operators. But Brand-A collected Person1 consent against service explicit or promotional messages. Consent can be collected via microsite signup/ missed call/ manual signing consent form etc. Then Brand A will upload Person1's name and Phone number in \"consent customer details\" to DLT. This list will overwrite the DND status DLT has for Person1 and is valid only for 6 months. Consent need to be refreshed after 6 months. DLT will then send me messages from Brand A only (for rest brands i remain DND). Screen reader support enabled.\nAs a single SMS will be sent to both DND & non DND users, If a customer has chosen not to receive SMS from brands, would the SMS be triggered & failed at delivery?\nYes, SMS will be triggered but fail at delivery if customer is in DND.\nDo you charge clients for such SMS failed at delivery?\nYes, we charge the same amount to Orgs (Gateway or operators have the same charge for delivered or non delivered).\nHow do we know the counts of customers who have not received SMS?\nYou will know the count from the delivery rate.\nWhether the delivery rates shown on campaign pages are accurate?\nDelivery rates shown on campaigns are accurate. We are also doing product enhancement to tell reasons for non delivery -should be live in next 1 month. Delivery rates for Promotional messages (numeric sender id) will be unknown as these are not shared by gateway partners after DLT regulation.\nSuppose a client doesn't want to target customers who have not opted to receive SMS from the brand, is there a provision to do so? Do we get such customer details from telecom operators?\nDND works at Category/ Industry level - not at brand level. So a customer will be in the NDNC list for retail and not for brand X. We get a DLR stating that the customer is DND - this happens only after we have tried to reach out to the customer but the delivery failed. There is no proactive system/ data in the public domain by which Capillary/ brand can know which customer is DND. We are thinking of making a reactive system by adding DND status to the customer after getting the DLR, but for this also we will have to trigger the message once to the customer. The enhancement is not confirmed and depends on tickets we get on this.\nIf we are not sending an opt out tag to the DND users, how will they opt out? Suppose I'm a DND customer and if I don't have an option to opt out I might raise a complaint which will result in bad customer service.\nCapillary can't make a change to the template registered for the Org in DLT. If the Marketer created a template with a #var where optout can be added, they can add the same from creative Labels as before.\nCan we directly sync templates from the DLT portal without having to upload it on Engage+?\nThe respective APIs are not provided by the DLT portals and hence you cannot access these templates from the portal directly as of now.\nDoes a template have an expiry associated with it post approval?\nA template is expired after 3 years post approval. However, the provision of deleting a template before 3 years is provided by both DLT portal and Engage+.\nWill the template overrides based on the template name?\nNo, the template override is based on the template ID which is the unique ID. If the template name is same, you will be asked to change it to make the search easier.\nWhy is there a limit of 500 rows per CSV file?\nThis is to provide a real-time experience to the customer and to reduce the load on the system, since the upload happens in real time. Also, if the customer wants to upload, say 1000 rows, he can always upload 2 CSV files containing 500 rows each. There is no limit on the number of CSV files to be uploaded.\nSome templates which were active at the time of upload have become inactive now, will it affect the delivery of SMS?\nIf the status is inactive, the operator will not broadcast the message to any customer even if the status was active at the time of upload. Therefore, it will affect the delivery of SMS.\nOffer\nCan we have more than one series per offer?\nCurrently, our system supports only one series per offer. However, we have taken this as a feature request.\nDoes the system support 100 % as discount value?\nCurrently, the system accepts only 2 digit values (supporting up to 99%). But considering some special cases we came across yesterday, we will get this to 100%.\nCan I tag customers to auto-generated coupon codes?\nYes, you can enable Issue to specific customers only in Coupons details and upload your customer list with any one of their identifiers (mobile no./email id, external id, user id). The auto-generated coupons are then tagged only to these customers.\nCan I configure the WeChat template for resending the coupon templates through POS?\nCurrently, we support only the SMS template.\nHow can I see no. of uploaded coupons?\nWhen you upload coupons, you will see the uploaded count. We will also make this available on the dashboard page.\nCan we change the discount once created?\nCurrently, you can change the discount value or discount type of an existing offer. However, we are still evaluating this feature.\nHow can I get the series id of a coupon through coupon/issue API?\nYou can get the series id through an API call. You can use series id, and Point of Sale (POS) identifier to consume an offer through API call.\nWhat happens if the expiry date of an offer is after the campaign expiry date?\nAfter the expiry date of a campaign, the offer is still valid but in campaign reporting, you will get details only till the campaign end date.\nWhat if my coupon expiry is after my Offer expiry?\nThe expiry of a specific offer coupon cannot go beyond the Offer expiry. Hence, irrespective of the expiry set for the coupons, the validity expires along with the associated offer.\nDo we have test vs. control in Loyalty?\nNo. We do not have a test vs. control check for the loyalty program.\nDo we need to reconfigure the loyalty program if we make any change in the Offers tab of Loyalty?\nNo, it is not required to reconfigure the loyalty program.\nWill there be any change in the isRedeemable get call nodes?\nWe will add an additional node - Max Discount. Rest everything will remain the same.\nCan we have the same offer names?\nYes, you can have duplicate offer names. But, it is highly recommended not to keep duplicate names, at least within a module.\nDLT\nDoes DLT templates stored in Capillary allow special characters and regional language text?\nSpecial Characters and Regional language are allowed even in Capillary templates. These need to be less than 30 characters if added in place of {{#var}} or it can be part of the static text approved from DLT. The 'Allow unicode characters' feature takes care of this. It is turned on by default. Screen reader support enabled.\nHow will a brand be onboarded for DLT compliance from an Engineering perspective?\nFor a detailed answer, click on this\nlink\n.\nCan we reach out to NDNC customers with a template with optout tag?\nReaching out to NDNC customers is directly handled by Telecom Operators - Airtel, Vodafone, Jio etc. The customers directly apply for NDNC to these operators. There are some extra settings, for example, customer can apply for NDNC but can wish to be reached out on certain days or time period. All this will be unknown to Capillary/ Gateway Partner/ Brand. So adding optout tag or not adding is irrelevant for NDNC. We can send entire customer list to operators and they can filter NDNC by their own. Screen reader support enabled.\nIn general, users copy and paste the templates from vendor portal to excel where space issues may occur. How to handle this?\nWe cannot handle space issues with static text. If space in coming in {#Var} field or just before it or after, it will be taken as 1 character. It is advisable that the excel downloaded from DLT portal is uploaded directly to Engage+. Copy/ pasting templates in excel or manual creation of DLT template upload excel is not advisable as error can occur not only in the template content but also other properties like template ID.\nHow can we target NDNC users?\nNDNC targeting can happen in the following way now. Suppose, Person1 is an NDNC customer. No brands can reach out to Person1 and this will be handled directly by operators as Person1 would have applied for DND with operators. But Brand A collected Person1 consent against service explicit or promotional messages. Consent can be collected through microsite signup/ missed call or manual signing consent form etc. Then, Brand A will upload Person1's name and Phone number in 'consent customer details' to DLT. This list will overwrite the DND status DLT has for Person1 and is valid only for 6 months. Consent need to be refreshed after 6 months. DLT will then send messages from Brand A only (for rest brands it remain DND).\nIs the order of column header names the same for all the DLT service providers?\nNo, the header names and column order can differ with different DLT providers. However, Engage+ understands which header name means what and hence the order does not really matter. Even the header names can vary from portal to portal (say, Template ID can be Temp ID for some service providers), but all such the cases will be handled by the product itself.\nI am not able to see sender IDs in the Delivery settings section even after sharing the sender IDs with the Gateway team?\nCapillary has enabled DLT compliance with three gateways namely Kaleyra, ICS, and Karix. If the Org is integrated with any other gateway the DLT feature will not work for that Org.\nDoes Capillary stored DLT templates allow special characters and Regional Language text?\nSpecial Characters and Regional language are allowed even in Capillary templates. These need to be less than 30 character if added in place of {{#var}} or it can be part of the static text approved from DLT. The 'Allow Unicode characters' feature takes care of this. It is turned on by default is on. Screen reader support enabled.\nIs the optout tag mandatory for DLT messages?\nOptout tag is not mandatory. If a brand wants to add it they need to add a #var in the content while getting it registered in DLT portal.\nCart Promotions\nWhat is the locking duration if the system doesn't receive any transaction/add?\nBrands can set up the duration for lock expiry. Config is provided in the strategy API. API to release these locked promotions is also provided in case where the auto-lock fails or we don't get the txnAdd or cancel cart call. Please refer to the\ndocumentation\nfor these APIs.\nHow payment promotion shall work if evaluation APIs are being consumed twice once during the cart promotion and another during the payment promotions for the same transaction?\nIf a previous cart evaluationID is passed in the evaluate call then we release the previously locked promotions and re-evaluate this second cart with added payment modes. If the evaluationID is already cancelled or processed via txnAdd, then we throw an error.\nWill it be compulsory for integration to call for a release of the lock?\nThere are 3 scenarios here,\nThe customer checks out i.e makes the payment - The cart is converted to a transaction after payment. The temp redemptions are marked as permanent.\nThe cart is canceled - In that case, temp redemption is reversed i.e. release the lock on the promotions\nFor some reason above does not happen in that case, the promotion will either get released based on default unlock duration set in strategy or you can use the cancel cart api to release them.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nMessages\nOffer\nDLT\nCart Promotions"

If the user declines, convincing them to re-enable push notifications can be challenging as they have the final decision to opt in or out.\nUsing a Push Primer in-app message before the system-level prompt to explain the benefits of enabling push notifications is an effective way to increase opt-in rates. This approach helps users make an informed decision and makes them more likely to opt-in to the push notification service.\nUpdated\n8 days ago\nWhat’s Next\nFrequently Asked Questions\nTable of Contents\nIncreasing Opt-Ins"

This status determines the reachability of the user for sending WhatsApp messages.\nReachability Calculation\n: The reachability of a user is calculated based on their subscription status. If a user is opted in, they are reachable for messages. If opted out, they will not receive further messages from the brand.\nSubscription Management Flow\n:\nOpt-In and Opt-Out\n: Users can manage their subscription status by replying with specific keywords (e.g., \"STOP\" or \"UNSUBSCRIBE\") to WhatsApp messages. This will trigger an event that updates their subscription status.\nReachability Updates\n: Changes in subscription status are reflected in the reachability calculations, impacting whether the user will receive future communications.\nUse Cases\n1.\nUser Opt-Out Scenario\nDescription\n: A user receives a promotional WhatsApp message from a brand. They decide they no longer wish to receive messages from this brand and reply with \"STOP.\"\nFlow\n:\nThe user's reply with the keyword \"STOP\" is captured as a user event.\nThe event is processed and is identified that the user wants to opt-out.\nThe user's subscription status is updated to \"opt-out\" in the subscription database.\nThe reachability of this user is recalculated to reflect their opt-out status.\nResult\n: The user will no longer receive any messages from the brand unless they opt in again.\n2.\nUser Opt-In Scenario\nDescription\n: After opting out previously, the same user decides to re-subscribe to the brand's WhatsApp messages by replying with \"SUBSCRIBE.\"\nFlow\n:\nThe user's reply with the keyword \"SUBSCRIBE\" is processed as a user event.\nThe event is processed updating the user's status back to \"opt-in.\"\nThe reachability of this user is recalculated to allow the reception of messages.\nResult\n: The user starts receiving messages from the brand again.\n3.\nUnrelated Message Handling\nDescription\n: A user sends a general message like \"Hello\" to a brand without opting in or out.\nFlow\n:\nThe message does not contain any subscription-related keywords.\nThe event is processed, but no changes are made to the user's subscription status.\nThe user remains in their current subscription status (opt-in or opt-out).\nResult\n: The user continues to receive or not receive messages as per their existing subscription status.\nManaging Subscription Status\nFor Opt-Out Requests\n: Ensure that keywords like \"STOP\" or \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" are included in the messages as part of the response strategy.\nFor Opt-In Requests\n: Design messages to allow users to re-subscribe with clear keywords.\nUpdated\n8 months ago\nTable of Contents\nKey Concepts\nUse Cases\nManaging Subscription Status"
