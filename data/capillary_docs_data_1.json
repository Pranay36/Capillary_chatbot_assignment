It provides the flexibility to create context-based loyalty programs, for example,\nBasic Loyalty Programs\nlet customers enroll in the loyalty program and get incentivized with points or coupons for every transaction they make.\nPaid enrollment programs\nare also called membership-based loyalty programs which allow customers to buy loyalty status (tier) to enjoy the tier benefits.\nCreate flexible tiers\nLoyalty+ provides you the flexibility to set up tier upgrade and downgrade conditions based on the customers' frequency of visits. You can also have tier upgrade based on purchases made by group members, customer tagging to customize the loyalty program to suit the brand’s needs.\nYou can configure conditions to downgrade their tier when they do not make any transaction for a certain period.\nFor example, assume that a loyalty customer makes frequent purchases in the first month and achieves a higher level tier and during the second month, the frequency of visits is low, you can downgrade the tier based on the recent transaction period.\nNumerous ways of incentivization\nThere are a number of different types of loyalty programs that can be configured using Loyalty+ and you can incentivize your customers in multiple ways, in the form of points, coupons, promotions, etc.\nIncentivize non-loyalty customers\nMoving the non-loyalty customers to loyalty customers can be done through various Loyalty+ drives. For example, Loyalty+ supports issuing coupons to non-loyalty customers on an event. This ultimately increases engagement and strengthens the Loyalty Base.\nIncentivization through payment modes\nLoyalty+ can be used to incentivize customers based on the payment mode used for a transaction. Loyalty+ supports incentivizing for different card types such as payments through Debit Cards, Credit Cards, Visa, and Mastercard. It also allows incentivizing bonus points based on banks. For example, award 10x points when a customer transacts with an HDFC card.\nOmnichannel Loyalty\nLoyalty+ supports Omni-channel loyalty, i.e., you can configure actions for the selected sources/accounts. The points are earned and burned seamlessly in online/offline platforms. Customers can be notified about the loyalty updates through a number of channels including SMS, email, Mobile Push and WeChat. All cross-channel registrations of a customer have been combined automatically and associated with a single account.\nLoyalty for Conglomerates\nOrganizations with multiple brands can configure a different loyalty program for each brand while maintaining a single customer profile across the organization using the Multiple Loyalty Programs (MLP) feature in Loyalty+. This feature can also be used to create multi-country loyalty programs.\nCommunication channels\nThe communication channels supported in the loyalty workflows are SMS, Email and Push notifications.\nUpdated\n8 months ago\nTable of Contents\nCreate flexible tiers\nNumerous ways of incentivization\nIncentivize non-loyalty customers\nIncentivization through payment modes\nOmnichannel Loyalty\nLoyalty for Conglomerates\nCommunication channels"

Industries that have a vast number of customers who make small purchases in every transaction would prefer these kinds of programs to convert more and more customers into regular shoppers by offering them incentives, whose value is derived from their engagement directly.\nTier Based Programs\n: These programs help customers earn additional benefits as they move up over other less engaged/loyal customers. Since getting into a higher tier is based on purchases/visits, the more loyal the customer is, the higher their tier is and the better their benefits are. These programs work for every industry, but would have significant impact on industries where a quality experience is the need since the purchases can be of high value and not very frequent.\nGamified Loyalty Programs\n: These programs bring out the competitiveness and interest in customers that a plain loyalty program might not. These can be posed as challenges which the customers can pass to earn stamps or badges, which may or may not have monetary value, but always do have a status attached to them, so the customers can have a feeling of exclusivity. These programs also help in community building and hence, organic marketing and growth. Gamification adds a fun element to the customer experience which can tend to be plain otherwise, hence not generating enough attention or interest from customers.\nCoalition Based Loyalty Program\n: These programs are made to combine incentives from two or more brands to customers in a single transaction. This helps the brands as this can lead to increased revenues for all parties involved and also help split the burden of the incentive costs among them. These programs include the ones based on tender modes, for example when customers get an additional discount when a particular card is used to pay for the products purchased from a retailer.\nRewards Based Loyalty Program\n: These programs are designed to reward customers in the form of benefits/incentives out of the custom designed rewards catalog instead of straight discounts and can help generate interest from customers.\nReferral Based Loyalty Program\n: These programs are designed to increase revenues for the brand through word of mouth referrals while creating extra benefits for customers for their referrals. If the product and loyalty program are up to the mark, these programs can create a lot of organic reach which results in a lower Cost of Customer Acquisition.\nConglomerate Loyalty\n: These programs aid the large corporations that would want to set up multiple loyalty programs for all the organizations under their umbrella to better cater to the respective customers of these organizations as keeping all organizations with one particular kind of program might not suit the strategies adopted by them according to their industries.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago"

During data import of promotional points, you can customize the awarded date. In the case of importing transaction points, the awarded date cannot be modified.\nDelayed accrual and promised points\nThe number of days in which points for a transaction actually get credited to the customer's current points. The points for a transaction are initially credited to the customer’s account as promised points. After the prescribed number of days, the points get credited to the current points after the delayed accrual period (configured by the org).\nFor example, if an apparel store has a return policy of seven days, and a customer buys a shirt and gets 20 points on this purchase. The points are reflected as promised points in the customer's account right after the purchase. These points are actually credited to the current account after seven days. However, if the customer returns the shirt (in the return period), the promised points will be reverted and current points will not be updated.\nDowngrade\nReducing the current tier of a customer to a lower tier is called tier downgrade. Brands can opt for tier downgrade on the basis of visit count and transactions. For example, downgrade the tier of a customer if no transaction is made in the last 6 months.\nExpired Points\nPoints that got expired because the customer did not use them within the validity period are called expired points.\nExpiry Date\nThe date on which awarded points get expired is known as the expiry date. The expiry date for particular points is always calculated with respect to the corresponding awarded date. It is derived by adding the expiry strategy to the awarded date.\nExpiry Strategy\nThe measure by which the points awarded to customers expire is called an expiry strategy. All points awarded to customers will get expired (if not used) as per the expiry strategy configured for these particular points.\nThere are multiple expiry strategies for a loyalty program. The default strategy is used for\nBillPointsAllocation action/AllocatePoints\naction. If none of the above-mentioned actions are configured in the point’s engine then it will consider the first expiry strategy that is configured.\nLifetime Points\nThe total number of points earned by a loyalty customer to date. Lifetime points are the sum of current points (active points), expired points, and redeemed points for a given customer.\nLine-item\nA transaction can have one or more products in it. Each different product in a transaction is considered a line item.\nLoyalty Points\nActive points in the customer’s loyalty account are called loyalty or current points. Customers are allowed to redeem their loyalty points based on the brands' redemption criteria.\nPromotional Points\nBonus points that are awarded to the customer irrespective of any transaction are called promotional points. These points are either awarded by the actual promotional campaigns or through import while balancing the customer’s lifetime points.\nRedeemed Points\nLoyalty points that are used by customers are termed redeemed points.\nTiers\nTiers are loyalty privileges that are awarded to loyalty customers. A brand can have one or more tiers. Tiers are required to be used by all organizations. If no tier is configured, one default tier is created by default.\nTransaction Level Points\nPoints that are awarded against a transaction made by the customer are called transaction points.\nIf transaction-level points are added or modified through import then transaction or transaction line-item profile has to be chosen.\nUpgrade\nMoving the customer to a higher tier is called tier upgrade. Brands can opt for tier upgrades on the basis of visit count and transactions. For example, upgrade the tier of a customer if 50 transactions are made in the last 100 days.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nAwarded date\nDelayed accrual and promised points\nDowngrade\nExpired Points\nExpiry Date\nExpiry Strategy\nLifetime Points\nLine-item\nLoyalty Points\nPromotional Points\nRedeemed Points\nTiers\nTransaction Level Points\nUpgrade"

When you have multi-loyalty programs configured for the org, points are issued from the program mapped to the TILL.\nHowever, this depends on the configuration. For example,  if a customer is enrolled in all the programs then the logic will run for all the programs but if the customer is only in one program then he will be evaluated for the rules written in that program and the points will be given for that program only. When it comes to an MLP kind of structure than one customer could be part of multiple programs or just one program and each program can have a different allocation strategy so all this is evaluated when the ‘add transaction’ call comes to us and whatever they are mapped to allocation happens as per that.\nIn the case of MLP, there are 2 programs that are always evaluated one is the default program for that ORG, and the other is where they are enrolled.\nCan I use a single loyalty program for multiple stores?\nYes, you can achieve this by applying scope to your rule in workflows.\nIs there a concept of equivalent tiers in loyalty programs? How is a single card which is used for different events mapped to the program? Is there a need/ solution for it in the loyalty program?\nTiers\nWhat is the difference between tier expiry and tier downgrade?\nTier expiry is when you have set a date for expiry and the user is automatically downgraded when the expiration date comes up. But when you are downgraded, you can basically set certain configurations, and depending on those configurations, the user will be downgraded.\nWhat happens to the status of my customer if he/she does not fulfill any of the tier eligibility criteria?\nBy default, the customer will be in the base tier of the program.\nDoes each of the renewal conditions have to be met or any one of them is enough?\nAs of now, it's an 'or' condition, so either of those conditions will result in a renewal.\nWill changing eligibility force the tiers to compute the settings for all users in advanced settings?\nYes, it depends on the tier evaluation cycle.\nCan I set an action in the workflows to send a communication to the customer after I retain the customer tier based on conditions such as at least 10 visits or 1000 points, even if the customer has not met the tier criteria?\nYes, that action can be set in the workflows.\nIs it possible to upgrade tiers by using any other means apart from the usual upgrade conditions like a coupon or passing the points rule?\nAs of now, you can do this manually through member care.\nWhen I configure 26K points to upgrade a tier (say Gold), will it consider 26,000 points or 26,001 to qualify?\nWhen configuring a tier, you will only see upgrade rules greater than or equal to (>=). Hence, a customer with 26000 points or more will be in the Gold tier.\nPoints\nCan I limit the number of times my customer can earn points?\nYou can limit the number of points a customer can earn in the points earning condition. However, there is no option to limit the number of times the points are issued for a customer.\nWhat is the use of proportion and max point allocation?\nUse Proportion lets you issue points based on the line item amount. The Maximum points allocation is to set a threshold value for the number of points a customer can earn.\nHow is the Transaction Points Allocation action different from Allocate Points?\n**Transactional Points** - Points you earn as per the configured ruleset for making a transaction.\nAllocate Points\n- Points you can assign on the transaction amount and custom field values based on the configured ruleset.\nTrackers\nWhat tracking method should I apply to the use case in the tracker?\n\"Reward a customer on their 10th visit\"\nYou could either use Cyclic Windows or Calendar-based Cyclic Window. However, it is recommended to use Cyclic Window in this case.\nIn a moving window tracking method, if the duration is 365 days and the tracking entity is a customer transaction, will it include the data of the current day also?\nIt will include the current date's data. For example, assume you are tracking customer transactions with a moving window tracking method with a duration of 365 days. If a customer does a transaction on  Nov 24, 2021, then the tracking window will be from Nov 23, 2020, to Nov 24, 2021 (including the dates mentioned).\nCan I use tracker for actions other than Tier Upgrade?\nYou can use trackers for Tier eligibility, tier renewals, customer milestones, incentivization, and other custom activities.\nIf a tier is upgraded using tracker value, does dynamic point earning work?\nYes, dynamic points earning will work for tier upgrades based on tracker value.\nWhat type of incentives are supported for tracker conditions?\nYou can award points and offers to customers on tracker aggregate.\nCan you share an example of a tracker which is used to issue coupons based on line-item purchases?\nIn cases where the brand doesn't want to credit the B2B customer every item they purchase (say cigarette/alcohol).\nFor example, In the case of Metro, if you don't want to incentivize customers on the purchase of cigarettes/alcohol. You can exclude such line item prices from the tracker.\nWill the Transaction Return be considered as a visit in a tracker?\nNo, Transaction Return will not be considered as a visit in any case.\nIs the Scope applied to the ruleset level or the entire workflow level?\n The scope you apply in Workflow will apply to that particular page (activity).\nReturn transactions\nWhat happens when no reference to original bill is passed or the reference bill no. passed in not found?\nThe return bill is submitted without storing any reference to the original bill.\nHow returns would be handled if there are two bill numbers with same purchase date?\nError is raised if multiple references are found. But, this is questionable, because the same return bill can be submitted if no reference to original bill is passed.\nWhat if the line items passed in the return bill do not match with the original bill?\nIt depends on the type of return - line item, full or amount. \nDepends on normal or mixed return.\nIf\ntype\nis line item, the line item will be matched with the line items in the original bill for amount, quantity, code, etc. If any of them do not match, error would be raised.\nIf normal return and type is amount, the amount at transaction level will be compared with the amount of original bill. It will also be checked whether any earlier return happened, and if there is any balance left for return.\nIf mixed return and type is amount, the amount mentioned in the line item will be compared with the amount in the original bill.\nIf type is full, all the line items would be returned.\nWhat if there are multiple line items with type amount for a mixed transaction?\nFor a mixed return transaction,\n1.First line item with return type amount would be considered a return transaction and would be compared with amount of original bill.\nSecond line item with type amount would be considered another return transaction. The amount would be compared with the balance amount (original amount - first return amount).\nIs it possible to return NI transaction without original bill reference?\nYes, it is possible. In this case, line level data will not be saved since no validation is possible. Only the amount will be returned.\nPoints only for the net amount (not on delivery fees, taxes, etc..)\nIs there a functionality to set across the board for all transactions not to include delivery fee and tax value to be included as points?\nAnswer\n:\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nLoyalty Programs (Single & Multi-Loyalty)\nTiers\nPoints\nTrackers\nReturn transactions\nPoints only for the net amount (not on delivery fees, taxes, etc..)"

So basically that becomes a non-loyalty transaction, and because of that, no loyalty benefits will be given to that customer.\nHowever, the same customer will call customer service sometime in the future, and request to convert that non-loyalty transaction in the past to a loyalty transaction. Upon validating a few details, generally, most airlines will agree to that. This is a case of a retro transaction.\nPrimary requisite to use retro functionality:\nWhenever a brand wants to utilize this retro transaction functionality, they have to raise a ticket with the sustenance team to configure a setting from the backend.\nScenarios of retro processing:\nThere are primarily two ways in which the retro processing will happen:\nWorkflow rules-based retro processing (point in time program and promotion configurations)\nTier-based retro processing (point in time tier of the customer)\nWorkflow rules-based retro processing:\nLet’s understand with the help of a real-case scenario. There is a customer who made a ‘non-loyalty’ transaction on 20th May 2023.\nHowever, the same customer called the customer service on 17th August 2023 requesting to convert that ‘non-loyalty’ transaction to a ‘loyalty transaction’.\nIn this case, had the brand already enabled ‘retro-transaction’, then the processing of that transaction should happen according to the workflow rules set on 20th May 2023.\nNow imagine this scenario:\nOn 20th May 2023, say the rules present in the workflow are ‘XYZ’.\nOn 10th August 2023, say the brand has changed those rules to ‘ABC’.\nNow, even though the processing should happen according to the rules presented on 20th May 2023, as the brand changed them on 10th August, our system doesn’t know what rules to compute the transaction. To avoid this, always create new set whenever you are replacing the rules in your workflows.\nIt could be as follows:\nHere, there is a brand that is using retro functionality, and they are changing their workflow rules on the 1st of July. So instead of replacing them in the same set, they created another set as follows:\nSet 2:\nJan 1st, 2023 to June 30th, 2023\nAction: Allocation of 98 points\nSet 3:\nJuly 1st, 2023 to August 31st 2023\nAction: Allocation of 89 points\nNow, when the processing of the ‘non-loyalty’ transaction happens based on the original date of 20th May 2023, our system has information on what rules to be computed.\nAs a result, even though processing happened on 17th August, the customer will get “98 points” as per the configs present during the 20th May 2023.\n“So whenever as a brand, you want to use retro functionality, make sure you are not replacing the existing rules, but rather creating a new set with the appropriate date as the scope”.\nImportant callout\nThe KPIs or trackers will always be evaluated as per the processing time of the event and not the bill date of the event. For eg. a sales tracker might have a value of 1000 as per the original bill date but in case of retro the current value will be taken for evaluation which might be more or less than 1000\nTier-based retro processing:\nSimilar to the above case, let’s say this time, the action is not simple points allocation, but rather some kind of setting depending on the tier of the customer.\nGold tier: 20% of the transaction amount\nSilver tier: 15% of the transaction amount\nBronze tier: 10% of the transaction amount\nNow, let’s say a customer made a ‘non-loyalty’ transaction on 20th May. At this time, the customer is present on “Silver-tier” but won’t get any benefits because that is a ‘non-loyalty’ transaction.\nThe same customer called the customer-care on 17th August requesting to change that transaction to a ‘loyalty’ transaction by providing the relevant details.\nMeanwhile, let’s say the following tier activity happened to the customer’s tier:\nDate\nCustomer's ier\n20th May 2023\nSilver\nOn 10th August, the customer made some big purchase, so his tier changed to ‘Gold’\nGold\n17th August 2023\nGold\nSo now, when the customer requested on 17th August to convert his non-loyalty transaction (which happened on 20th May 2023) to a loyalty transaction, here is what happens:\nOur computation will check on which tier the customer is present on the original transaction.\nAs the customer is present on “Silver tier” as per the original transaction date, computation will happen according to that.\nSo the customer will get 15% points based on the amount of that transaction.\nAPI details:\nSearching for an older transaction:\nHere\nTo request a retro approval:\nHere\nTo approve the above request:\nHere\nUpdated\nabout 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nAir lines example:\nPrimary requisite to use retro functionality:\nScenarios of retro processing:\nWorkflow rules-based retro processing:\nTier-based retro processing:\nAPI details:"

These actions are referred to as \"rolling events.\" Points rolling expiry allows you to control when loyalty points expire, ensuring that points remain valid as long as the customer continues to engage in rolling events.\nWhen a rolling event occurs, the expiry date for all points earned is updated or rolled to a later date. The \"rolling window\" determines how far this expiry date is extended. For example, a rolling window of 12 months will extend the expiry date of the earned points by 12 months.\nIncluding Zero Points in Rolling Expiry\nBy default, the rolling expiry process only considers points with a value greater than zero. If a customer performs a rolling event and receives no points for it, the system will not consider the rolling event even if it is valid, and the expiry window is not extended. To consider zero points, you can enable\nROLLING_EXPIRY_INCLUDE_ZERO_POINTS\nto ensure that even zero-value points are considered for extending the expiry.\nFor example:\nA retail loyalty program allows customers to earn points on purchases. Points expire after 12 months unless they engage in a rolling event — such as making another purchase — to extend the expiry.\nA customer earns 100 points in January 2024, with a 12-month rolling expiry (set to expire in January 2025).\nNow, in December 2024, the customer purchases as part of a special promotion. However, this promotion does not award any new points (0 points are awarded).\nWith\nROLLING_EXPIRY_INCLUDE_ZERO_POINTS\nDisabled:\nSince the promotion awards 0 points, it is ignored by the rolling expiry.\nThe customer’s\n100 points still expire in January 2025\n.\nWith\nROLLING_EXPIRY_INCLUDE_ZERO_POINTS\nEnabled:\nThe system recognizes the\n0-point award purchase as a valid rolling event\n.\nThe\nexpiry date of the 100 points is extended to August 2026\n.\nTo enable\nROLLING_EXPIRY_INCLUDE_ZERO_POINTS\n,  raise a ticket to the sustenance team.\nCreating a Points Rolling Expiry\nTo configure the points rolling expiry for a loyalty program, follow these steps:\nOn the Loyalty+ home page, navigate to the\nSettings\npage by clicking the\nicon\nSelect\nPoints Rolling Expiry\nfrom the menu.\nEnable points rolling expiry for all programs using the\nPoints rolling expiry across program\ntoggle.\nSelect the rolling expiry strategy using the\nPoints rolling expiry strategy\ndropdown.\nThe rolling expiry strategies are as follows:\nRolling Expiry Strategy\nDescription\nExample\nMaximum expiry date\nAll points earned by the customer are assigned a single expiry date. If the date passes without a new rolling event, the expiry date for the points is reset to the\nexpiry conditions\nconfigured within the loyalty program. This applies to points with a 'rolling' expiry strategy.\nA  customer earns points on January 1st 2025. The following configurations define the expiration of the points earned by the customer:\n- Points expiry for loyalty program: six months from date of issual (July 1st 2025).\n- Points rolling expiry strategy: 12 months from the date of issual.The customer makes a transaction on June 1st 2025, extending the expiry to June 1st of the following year (2026). If no further rolling events occur and the rolling window date (June 1st, 2026) has passed, the points will expire on this day.\nAdd one more rolling window\nIf no rolling events happen during the last rolling window, the expiry date is extended by another rolling window. The strategies for which the rolling window applies can be selected.\nRefer to the\nexpiry conditions table\nfor more information on the strategies available for points expiry.\nA customer earns points that expire after 12 months. If no rolling events occur during this time, the expiry date automatically extends by another 12 months.\nSelect the expiry strategies for which the rolling window is applied using the\nTypes of points expiry strategies to be rolled over\ndropdown. This is applicable for the\nAdd one more rolling window\nrolling expiry strategy.\nEnter the period for the rolling window and select the units (\nDays\nor\nMonths\n) from the dropdown menu.\nSelect the customer activities for which the rolling window is applied using the\nCustomer activities for points expiry extension\ndropdown.\nFor more information on the types of activities and events, refer to the documentation on\ncustomer activities\nand\nbehavioural events\n.\nSelect\nDone\nto save the changes and create a points rolling expiry.\nThe points rolling expiry for all loyalty programs is successfully created.\nEditing a Points Rolling Expiry\nOn the Loyalty+ home page, navigate to the\nSettings\npage by clicking the\nicon.\nSelect\nPoints Rolling Expiry\nfrom the menu.\nEdit the required fields.\nSelect\nDone\nto save the changes.\nThe points rolling expiry for all loyalty programs is successfully edited.\nUpdated\nabout 1 month ago\nTable of Contents\nIncluding Zero Points in Rolling Expiry\nCreating a Points Rolling Expiry\nEditing a Points Rolling Expiry"

They may also have brands spanning multiple countries and want a program that supports all of these different spectrums.\nAs companies move towards giving customers a global experience they may want a situation where a customer signed up in Country A, they can go to Country B and say they are a member and then redeem the points they earned in Country A. This would mean that a member of the topmost tier would receive all of the perks, no matter which country the member traveled to and that is a very attractive incentive that can be provided to customers.\n📘\nAn org cannot have one program for a zone and another for a concept.\n📘\nIn MLPs, you have a single customer database for different programs across different industries, countries, etc.\nUse Cases\nConglomerate businesses that have multiple brands ranging from, say, apparel to pharma and healthcare. All of these kinds of businesses may be experiencing very common programs like cash back or gift vouchers and other programs like that and multiple different brands across industries can come together and form a single program where customers can earn in one program. Also, using MLPs, these brands can have their own tier and earn conditions.\nGlobal companies can run cross-border loyalty program each with their own local flavors\nBrands can cater to different customer segments and needs by having multiple types of memberships\nFor programs created through multiple partnerships that are integral parts of the program\nBasic concepts of Multi-loyalty Programs.\nAn org will have a Default Loyalty Program (org level program) that is created while setting up the org on InTouch.\nThe Default Loyalty Program is applicable to all zones/concepts and the individual loyalty program is applicable to the zone/concept/card series. So a zone or concept can have two loyalty programs - one is the program created for that particular zone/concept and the other is the default program.\nBased on the Till from which an event is triggered, the system identifies the respective zone/concept and initiates the loyalty program associated with it.\nIf an event such as a transaction or registration is triggered, the system first identifies the loyalty program associated with the Till and executes the rules and actions associated with the program.\nIf two programs are identified, then the system executes both programs.\nStrategies or configurations of a loyalty program will be applicable only for that program.\nLimitations of MLP\nFor an org, you can create programs either on concepts or zones but not both.\nA zone, concept, or card series can have only one loyalty program (excluding the default program).\nA store or Till cannot have multiple loyalty programs (excluding the default loyalty program).\nProduct category/brand-based loyalty program configurations are not available.\nPoints or coupons are redeemed from one program at a time.\nMultiple currencies are not supported across loyalty programs.\nAn org can either have zone-based, concept-based, or card-series-based loyalty programs. You cannot have one with concept-based (OU) and another with card-based.\nTransaction Behavior\nNew Transaction\n- Once a transaction is made, the corresponding programs are identified, and accordingly “new transactions” rules will execute.\nTransaction Update\n- Any transaction update event will only pass through the corresponding program that is configured for the till from which the update event is initiated. In case the transaction add and transaction update tills are different then rules will run for the program where the transaction has originated.\nTransaction Return\n- For the Transaction return event, the rules are executed from the program where the purchase was made, not where the return is made. For example, if a customer transacts at till 1(Program 1) but returns products at till 3 (Program 2), in this case, the return rules are executed from Program 1, not from Program 2.\nTypes of multi-loyalty program\nOU-based Loyalty\nEach loyalty program needs to be configured in the system and there should be a defined boundary between each program. For example, if a conglomerate wants to run different brands, say\nTrends\n,\nJewel\n, and\nFoodworld\n, working across zones\nEast\n,\nWest\n, and\nSouth\n. In this case, conglomerates can either run loyalty programs at a brand level (concept) or zone level.\nAlso, if an org runs in different countries, you can run a separate loyalty program for each country. The following are the different functionalities supported for an org that runs in different countries. For details, see here.\nIndependent Programs for each of the countries.\nSeparate earning rules and tiers across countries.\nSeparate redemption rules across countries.\nSeparate points-to-currency ratio.\nIndependent Programs for each of the countries + 1 Umbrella Program\nSeparate earning and redemption rules for independent programs.\nAdditionally, One umbrella group program for a group of countries.\nEarn points in the umbrella group program on purchases in any of the countries.\nUnified/Single Group Program\nSeparate earning rules and tiers across countries.\nSingle points balance for the end customer.\nA common set of redemption rules across countries.\nSingle points-to-currency ratio.\nOther types of loyalty programs that brands can achieve through MLP.\nMulti-Currency and Multi-Country Programs\nOPTION\nDESCRIPTION\nBill Amount\nCaptures in local currency and uses conversion ratio for local-to-base currency conversion.\nBill Amount in Loyalty\nPoints on a bill amount in on the base currency.\nPoints Earning\nPoints on a bill amount in on the base currency.\nUpgrade on Amount\nEarning of points/bill amount in base currency or based on the custom field of bill amount in local currency.\nPoints Redemption across Programs\nSingle redemption across programs with single points-to-currency conversion (upcoming).\nPoints Redemption Discount\nCurrency is not applicable for points discount.\nCard-based Loyalty\nA group company issues multiple loyalty cards of that org and a customer could have one or more loyalty cards that they can use across countries. The loyalty benefits such as points balance, earning rules, redemption rules, tiers, etc - are associated with a loyalty card (and not a country). For details, see\ncard series overview\n,\ncreate card series\n,\ngenerate a card number\nand\nissue a card to a customer\n.\nGetting Started\nAll orgs start off with a single Loyalty Program - this is and becomes the “Default” program for the org.\nOnce you ascertain the need for an MLP and it has been subscribed - raise a request via JIRA to enable MLP specifying the type of MLP needed (Note: The type can’t be changed later on)\nYou can then start creating more programs and mapping different card series, concepts or zones to the new programs\nYou can’t change the mapping once set so take care to set this up properly\nOne program can have multiple zones, concepts or card series mapped to it, but one zone/concept or card series can only be mapped to a single program\nThis graph shows the KPI trend for the whole org, not individual org units.\nCreate Zone/Concept/Card series based Loyalty Program\nBefore creating a new program for the org, you need to create a ticket to the support team or PM team requesting your preferred categorization - on what basis do you want loyalty programs to be created for your org. You can have zone, concept, or card series.\nTo create a loyalty program for an Org Unit, follow these steps.\nLog on to\nInTouch\n.\nIn the menu, click\nLoyalty+\n.\nClick\nCreate Program\nto create a new program.\nOn the\nCreate Program page\n, enter the program details. Refer to the table for field descriptions\nOPTION\nDESCRIPTION\nName\nSpecify a name for the current loyalty program.\nSpecial characters such as:\n! @ # $ % ^ & \\* ( ) - \\_ = + \\\\ | [ ] { } ; : / ? . >\nare unsupported.\nDescription\nEnter a short description of the program.\nAdd contributors\nAdd the capillary POCs that you want to notify on modifications in the loyalty program (reconfigured).\nSelect Entities\nYou will see either zones, concepts, or card series based on the org's program type.\nAdd zone(s), concept(s), or card series that you want to associate with the current loyalty program.\nSelecting\nROOT\nselects all the listed options.\nClick\nSave\n. A blank loyalty program is created without any configurations.\nIf the program is inactive, select the program and click\nSave\non the activation prompt that appears.\nOnce the program is enabled, click on the program to open and click\nEdit program\n.\n📘\nTo modify details of a loyalty program, click\nEdit program\n.\nWhile configuring ensure that there is no overlap between the two loyalty programs.\nTo inactivate a loyalty program, open the program > Click on the\nEdit\nicon > Disable\nActivate Program\n> Click\nSave\n.\nCustomer activities\n: For any activity such as transaction and customer update, first, the relevant programs will be identified and then the configured rules and actions will be executed for that particular program.\n📘\nThe default program will always be executed. However, if the event also matches with any other non-default program, that will also be executed.\nGet Details (API)\n: Whenever any information such as Current points, tier, and the bulk call is required, either the calling module will pass the corresponding program or the system will identify the corresponding program from the configuration and pass the relevant value to the caller.\nSignificance of Default Program\nAll customer activities and events will necessarily be “evaluated” by the default program, so the default program acts as sort of the global or umbrella program for MLP setups\nActions and configs wrt to umbrella program type setting need to be configured inside the default program (e.g. group redemptions)\nAs of now, Referral and User Group based Loyalty are only supported inside the Default Program\nIn addition to the default program, one other program is also evaluated based on the store concept, zone or card series used. For concept, if a customer shops in a grocery chain, they would be added to that program. For zone, if a customer shops in, say, west Singapore, they wuld be added to that program. For cards, it depends on the type of card that is presented.\nPoints in MLP\nEarn Anywhere, Burn Anywhere\nThe points awarded from programs along with the earn conditions, and expiry conditions are all contained in sort of individual “accounts” as part of the program\nHowever MLP allows a feature of allowing the points to be used in a fungible manner across all the programs at the time of redemption or transfer\nStep 1: Navigate to the Default Program > Workflows\nStep 2: Select the\ncurrentEvent\nactivity, and set the rule\nisGroupProgramRedemption\nto True.\nStep 2: Select the the “Redeems Points” customer activity\nStep 3: Add the action “Redeem group points”\n(the default redemption strategy would be decided based on the program strategy)\nStep 4: Repeat the same for “Transfer Points” activity as well using the “Transfer group points” action\nStep 5: In the API for redemption use the parameter ”group_redemption”: true  and for transfer use ”groupProgramTransfer”: true  in the request body\nNote: The system automatically chooses the earliest expiring points across all programs to redeem or transfer and in case of transfers the points are transferred to the default program of the recipient\nSingle Rolling Expiry\nThe basic option of rolling expiry works only for “Makes a transaction” event and works only for the points within that particular program\nWhat if you want to have points rolling together across all programs for different events - single rolling expiry helps to achieve this (this is not present inside Loyalty+ right now, you would need to go to organsation settings)\nStep 1: Navigate to the Organisation Settings > Miscellaneous > Points Management > Single Points Expiry\nStep 2: Check the option to enable Single Rolling Expiry across programs\nYou can define the rolling period in Days or Months - The period configured here will now override the duration configured inside the Rolling Expiry conditions\nYou can also select the various events that will cause points to roll across all programs\nNote: This setting continues to roll only the points that were awarded using some rolling expiry condition, all other points do not roll\nConfigure Strategies\nPoints Allocation Strategy\n: Each program has its own points allocation strategies. A point allocation strategy can be created and used within a program. The allocation strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even within the Default Program. To know how to create Points Allocation Strategies, click\nhere\n.\nPoints Expiry strategy\n: Each program has its own points expiry strategy. A point expiry strategy can be created and used within a program. The expiry strategy of one point cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. To know how to create Point Expiry Strategy, click\nhere\n.\nPoints Redemption Strategy\n: Each program has its own points redemption strategy and points to currency conversion ratio. The redemption strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. Points redemption strategies can be created and used within a program. To know how to create points redemption strategies, click\nhere\n.\nWhile making redemption, the caller has to specify from which program and how much point needs to be redeemed. Whenever a redemption call is made and the program id is not passed, the points will deduct from the program/till where the redemption call is made.\nManage Trackers\n: Trackers created within a program can be used and evaluated within the program. It will work the same as in the case of a single loyalty program. Tracker of one program can not be used or evaluated in any other program, not even in the default program. To know more click\nhere\n.\nCustomer Registration\n: Customer once registered in any program by default will register across brands in the org but the enrollment will be done only for the program where the till belongs to.  Enrollment in other brands will not happen till the customer makes a transaction in that program.\nCustomer updates\n: Customer update events will pass through all the programs which as associated with the till from where the event is fired. So if the Org wants to allocate points to the brand loyalty program or Default program, then they have to write rules on the brand loyalty program and Default program as well.\nManage Tiers\n: Tiers for each program can be created within the program and they work within the program only. Click\nhere\nto know more.\nConfiguring Rules/Sets\nRule and set configuration need to be configured at the program level depending on the requirement. The rules configured for lifetime purchases, current points, and no. of transactions, are always in the context of the program.\nFor example, let's assume a customer has made 6 transactions across the organization in different tills/stores.\nIf one writes a rule within program 1 on\ncurrentcustomer.lifetimepurchase\n, it will be evaluated on 1200, and on program 2, it will be evaluated on 900. Moreover, each program will have over customer KPIs such as Lifetime purchase, current points, lifetime points, trackers Visit count, and the number of transactions. Click\nhere\nto know more.\nView Loyalty Details on Member Care\nYou can see program-wise (including Default Program) details of a customer with program-level KPIs in Member care and Binary.\nHandling MLP Integrations\nCustomer Enrollments\nCDP Registration and Program enrollment are distinct events and customers will have to be individually enrolled in each program\nFor Card series, an additional integration option will be to use the\nhttps://{host}/v2/customers/{userId}/changeIdentifier\nAPI to add a new card from that card series to the customer to enrol them to that program\nNote: Enrolling customers across multiple brands, countries and programs will be subject to local state, country and global laws on privacy and consent - please ensure they are adhered to at the time of integration\nPosting transactions and events\nTransactions and other events posted via APIs are always evaluated by the default program and resolved & evaluated by any 1 other non-default program based on the till_id or store code associated with the authorisation used - this is in case of zone or concept based MLP\nNote: In case invalid or non-existent till code is passed while using oAuth then system would assume the admin till and process the event only within the default program\nIn case of card series based MLPs, during integration it has to be ensured that the card number is used as the identifier across all available events - this causes the right program to be chosen for evaluation based on the card series.\nNote: In case the card number is not passed, then the event will only be evaluated by the default program\nFetching MLP details\nMost Fetch APIs by default will only provide the loyalty details of the default program for the customer when fetching\nWatch for explicit parameters in the request to fetch details across all programs or other programs\nThe exact param would be different across different APIs - so please refer to the documentation for each API\nMost APIs will also commonly support program_id as a query parameter to pass the program ID and get the specific details for that particular program\nFetching details across multiple programs in a single request can result in bulky responses that can be slow and increase network costs, instead try to use one program at a time as needed and use light APIs whenever available (e.g. points expiry schedule, tier details, etc.)\nFAQs\nCan a TILL have two loyalty programs?\nNo. For an org, a loyalty program can be created either for a zone or concept but not both. For example, an org cannot have one loyalty program for a zone and another for a concept.\nWhat is the default loyalty program?\nIt is the base loyalty program of the org which is created by default, all zones/concepts of an org are part of the default program as shown in the illustration. Default programs work as a normal program with its own slab, strategies, and rules.\n📘\nAll programs of an org, either default or brand specific one, runs independently and are not related or dependent on other programs.\nCan points earned in one program be burned in another program?\nYes.\nCan points earned in one country be burned in another country for the same org?\nIt completely depends on the implementation.\nCan we change the default loyalty program?\nNo. Default loyalty program is created at the org level once the Loyalty module is enabled for that org. Every brand (concept/zone) can have only one loyalty program (except the default program). You can create slabs, points strategies, and rules for each program just like a normal loyalty program\nCan multiple programs run on a same till?\nNo\nWhat if a store that is mapped to a zone changes through import?\nProgram will work as per new zone loyalty configuration and you can fetch customer details program wise. However, the loyalty details such as points earned, points burned are still associated to the previous program.\nWill there be any change in  Sharingan for MLP?\nNo changes are required for the existing functionalities. However, if MLP is required, then integration needs to be changed accordingly.\nWill there be any change in e-com for MLP?\nNo changes are required in the existing functionalities. However, if MLP is required, then integration needs to be changed accordingly.\nHow to use APIs in case of cross-brand redemption?\nYou have to pass the program id from which the redemption is required, if program id is not passed then it will try to redeem from the till's program.\nIf no program id is passed while redeeming points, from which program the points will be deducted?\nPoints are deducted from the non-default loyalty program which the current TILL is mapped to. However, if the till is not mapped to any loyalty program, points will be deducted from the default program.\nWhat should I do when I get an error\ngroup redemption action executed for non group redemption payload\n?\nMake sure that you have set the following:\nMake sure that the config\nENABLE_GROUP_PROGRAM_REDEMPTION\nis enabled.\nMake sure that the\nparameter group_redemption\nis set to true`.\nMake sure that the loyalty workflow rule\ncurrentEvent.isGroupProgramRedemption\nis set to true.\nGroup redemption event configured under loyalty workflow and enabled the group redemption option and also enabled the “allow skipping validation” under redemption setting for marvel api to work….Is there any other configs..\nAccording to the system, for group program redemption scenario to be handled properly, there has to be a rule called “currentEvent.isGroupProgramRedemption” set properly in the condition, and depending on whether it is true or false, the appropriate redeem points action should be set for it, as can be seen here from the screenshot.\nUpdated\n5 months ago\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nUse Cases\nTypes of multi-loyalty program\nGetting Started\nCreate Zone/Concept/Card series based Loyalty Program\nSignificance of Default Program\nPoints in MLP\nEarn Anywhere, Burn Anywhere\nSingle Rolling Expiry\nConfigure Strategies\nConfiguring Rules/Sets\nView Loyalty Details on Member Care\nHandling MLP Integrations\nPosting transactions and events\nFetching MLP details\nFAQs"

An individual can belong to multiple user groups. An org can designate different roles to these members and incentivize them according to the org’s preference. User group loyalty allows an org to incentivize not only its customers but also incentivize other business entities or individuals that contribute to their profits. It is a customer retention solution with custom group structures and includes generic loyalty mechanics which helps an org to establish brand loyalty.\nIn user group loyalty, an individual’s (member of a group) action will lead to other group members being rewarded.\nFor example, if a fleet driver fills petrol from BPCL, the manager of the fleet group can receive points for the transaction.\nThis way of incentivizing the upper management encourages other members of the group to transact from an org.\nKey Concepts\nThe following are some of the key concepts of user group loyalty\nIn B2B Loyalty, an org is identified as an entity.\nAn individual can be part of multiple groups.\n📘\nYou can configure the total number of groups that a member can be part of.\nThe parent control or the admin role can be transferred from one member to another.\nPermissions to manage group benefits.\nA member of a group can still make individual transactions.\nAll the members in a group can pool in their transactions for a tier upgrade.\nPoints return and downgrade checks are supported in case of transaction return.\nBoth the group and the individual can be incentivized when they transact while representing the group.\nDifference between B2B and B2C\nThe existing user group programs (B2C or friends and family programs) only cater to customers and include family members and friends of these customers. These groups have a primary member who can redeem points and secondary members as well. In the B2C model, with the help of the Engage+ platform, orgs are able to directly benefit the primary member of the group, ignoring the secondary members. B2C model has only one primary member with multiple secondary associated.\nThe B2B user group programs aim to involve all members in the group actively by incentivizing everyone based on their roles in the group. B2B user group programs also include all the functionalities of the existing B2C programs.\nUse Cases\nFollowing are the different scenarios where user group loyalty is applicable for both B2B and B2C scenarios.\nB2B Loyalty\nVertical\nDescription\nFleet Loyalty\nFuel Brands can enroll fleet companies in their B2B loyalty programs. Fleet Drivers can earn loyalty points by purchasing fuel at retail outlets but points redemption can happen by fleet owners who are in the same group as the driver.\nCorporate Loyalty Programs\nPoints earned by an employee of a company enrolled in a B2B loyalty program can be redeemed at the company level where other members of the company will also enjoy the benefits of the transaction made by a particular employee.\nCPG and Distributor Loyalty Programs\nA sales structure where existing distributors can recruit new distributors to sell the products. Distributors make money through a percentage of their recruits' sales and also direct sales of products to customers.\nAffiliate Marketing Programs\nThe affiliate enrolled in the program can make customers buy products. With a product purchased by the customer, the rewards are accrued to the affiliate's account.\nB2C Loyalty\nVertical\nDescription\nHospitality and Restaurants\nHotel chains and restaurants where repeat customers drive significant value and family group engagement are very high can leverage this structure to boost profit and to drive stickiness.\nRetail\nRetail brands such as apparel, beauty, etc. can incentivize customers to engage with the brand as a group of friends or as a family to accrue benefits together in an accelerated fashion to get better returns.\nHealthcare\nHospitals and pharmacy chains can provide benefits to the entire family as part of insurance tie-ups and subscriptions.\nAirports and Airlines\nAirline Miles and other benefits such as lounge access and class upgrades can be provided to the entire family group.\nImportant Terminologies\nCompany\n: Any business entity which is enrolled in the brand’s B2B loyalty program.\nSub-company\n: A smaller business entity associated with a Company. For example, a big company like Tata can be registered as a company while Tata Motors, TCS can be registered as sub-companies.\nCustomer Role\n: Role is used to capture the association between customer and company. A company can have customers in various roles. For example, a company enrolled in a fleet loyalty program of a brand can have customers in various roles like a driver, associate, owner, etc.\nCustomer Hierarchy\n: Customer hierarchy is used to capture the association between two customer roles. To know how to create and configure a hierarchy, click here.\nHow a User Group works\nA user group includes a primary member and multiple secondary members. The concept of incentivizing and tier rewarding at the group level is called Group Loyalty, In group loyalty, when a secondary member makes a transaction, you can issue points to both secondary and the primary member.\nTier upgrade is on the basis of cumulative purchases of group members (if the upgrade strategy for the program is on lifetime purchases). Hence, the tier of all the group members remain the same (as per the primary member). When a secondary member leaves the group, his/her tiers downgrades to the lowest tier.\nThe common tier is achieved through the syncing of the secondary member's tier with the primary member's. Tier syncs either upgrade or downgrade when a secondary member makes a transaction or joins the group. The sync includes both upgrade and downgrade.\nCreating a User Group\nCreating a user group involves two steps -\nAdding a group with the primary member.\nAdding group members (secondary members).\nFor details of each user group API, see the User Groups of the V2 API Documentation.\nYou can create user groups through API POST /usergroups. Using identifiers of the primary member, there are two approaches of creating a user group.\nUser ID of the primary member (which is generated internally when registering).\nWith InTouch credentials of the primary member.\nAdd each secondary member to the group using the API POST /{groupId}/members/{userId}, either with user Id or identifiers.\nConfigure the loyalty program. There are new events introduced for Group Loyalty - Group Transaction Add, Group Transaction Update, and Group Return Transaction. You can create rules for these events as required.\nPoints pooling from secondary members to the primary member\nLoyalty+ allows transferring of points earned for an event by a secondary member to the primary member automatically for each event.\nTo enable transferring points for an event, you will need to change the Advanced Settings for Friends & Family Program, see more about this [here](desired level of precision, contributing to consistency and accuracy in financial calculations).\nCommunicating group points to the primary member\nOn the Workflow, select the customer activity PointsContributionToGroup and set the action Points Contribution to Group.\nYou can see options to configure messages for the primary member and secondary member.\nConfigure the message for primary and secondary members separately and click Save.\nCurrently, you can use communication to notify the primary member that points are credited to his loyalty account for an activity done by a secondary member of the group. Similarly, you can also notify the secondary member that points are transferred to the primary member. Points pooling tags are still in the development phase.\nClick Reconfigure save the changes in the live program.\nTo see the points contribution or points pooling of secondary members, use v2/usergroups/pointContributionHistory. For more details, see V2 API Documentation.\nGroup transaction (Add, Update, and Return)\nThere are new events introduced for Group Loyalty - Group Transaction Add, Group Transaction Update, and Group Return Transaction.\nActions supported for Group Loyalty\nAll the loyalty actions (such as points allocation, coupon issual, communication) for group events is for the primary member and the respective secondary member.\nFor example, points could be allocated for a new transaction (transaction/add) to the member who made the transaction, and also allocate points to the primary member for the Group Transaction/Add event.\nPoints import for the primary member\nSupport for  importing Bill Promotion points and Line Item Promotion points for the primary member of a group\nby enabling the Import on group primary customer option during import.\nIn Import profiles, Bill Promotion Points and Line Item Promotion Points, for a group, customer refers to the primary member of the group, and original customer refers to the secondary member who made the transaction.\nTier syncing of secondary members and primary members\nWhen a secondary member joins a group, the tier of the secondary members is upgraded or downgraded to that of the primary member's. The following sections provide how the tier of secondary members is effected in different scenarios.\nWhen a secondary member joins/leaves the group\nWhen a secondary member joins a group, his/her tier is upgraded or downgraded as per the tier of the primary member. When a secondary member leaves a group, his/her tier is downgraded to the lowest tier of the program.\nHowever, if the secondary member is qualified for tier upgrade due to individual KPIs,  the tier is upgraded on the first transaction after leaving the group. The individual KPIs refer to the member’s current points, lifetime points, or lifetime purchases as per the tier upgrade strategy. The individual KPI values include the activities of the member within the group and outside the group.\nFor example, assume a member has made three transactions as mentioned in the following. The member’s lifetime purchase = B1 + B2 + B3 and member’s lifetime points = P1 + P2 + P3.\n▪ Bill 1 (before the member joined the group) – Points allocated: P1\n▪ Bill 2 (when the member was in the group as a secondary member) – Points allocated: P2\n▪ Bill 3 (after the member left the group) – Points allocated: P3\nTier upgrade on transactions of group members\nWhen a secondary member makes a transaction, the group transaction is evaluated first. If the program uses lifetime purchases as the upgrade strategy, and the primary member is eligible for the upgrade, firstly, the primary member is upgraded and then the secondary member who made the transaction will also be upgraded.\nThe tier upgrade for both the primary member and the secondary member who made the transaction happen in the same event flow. The tier of the other members of the group will not upgrade in the same event flow.\nHowever, if another secondary member makes a transaction, his/her tier is upgraded with the tier of the primary member.  In this, the secondary member is first upgraded to the new tier, and then the transaction/add event is evaluated.\nThis states that the tier upgrade of the secondary member will always be in Eager mode irrespective of the tier upgrade strategy type (Eager, Dynamic or Lazy). Only the tier of the primary member upgrades according to the tier upgrade strategy type.\nFor example ◦ A group has 4 members – P1 (Primary), S1, S2, and S3 (Secondary)\nT = T1, S1 makes a purchase\n▪ On the purchase, P1 gets eligible for the tier upgrade.\n▪ P1 gets upgraded first and then\n▪ S1 gets upgraded.\nT = T2, S2 makes a purchase\n▪ Loyalty checks if the primary member P1 is already upgraded\n▪ S2 gets upgraded\n▪ Event rule gets evaluated\nT = T3, S3 makes a purchase\n▪ Loyalty checks if the primary member P1 is already upgraded\n▪ S3 gets upgraded\n▪ Event rule gets evaluated\nTier upgrade of a secondary member on purchases made of the primary member\nScenario: The tier of the primary member upgrades due to a transaction made or an import.\nIn both cases, the tier of each secondary member is upgraded only when the member makes a transaction (after the tier upgrade of the primary member) in Eager mode. That is, the tier of the secondary member is first upgraded and then the transaction/add event is evaluated.\nFor example:\nA group has 4 members – P1 (Primary), S1, S2, and S3 (Secondary)\nT = T1, P1 makes a purchase\n▪ On the purchase, P1 gets applicable for upgrade\n▪ P1 gets upgraded\nT = T2, S1 makes a purchase\n▪ Loyalty checks if the primary member P1 is already upgraded\n▪ S2 gets upgraded ▪ Event rule gets evaluated\nT = T3, S3 makes a purchase\n▪ Loyalty checks if the primary member P1 is already upgraded\n▪ S3 gets upgraded\n▪ Event rule gets evaluated\nTier Downgrade of secondary members\nThe tier of secondary members is downgraded only when the tier of the primary member downgrades.\nIf the downgrade See the Primary Member Downgrade on Purchase or Visits section for the primary member downgrade if downgrade strategy is based on Purchase or Visits  Primary Member Downgrade on Earned Points section covers primary member downgrade if downgrade strategy is based on Earned Points\nTier upgrade of the primary member on lifetime purchases\nIf the tier upgrade  (in tier upgrade strategy) is set based on Lifetime Purchases, then for the primary member it is the sum of lifetime purchase of the primary member and purchases done by the secondary member while they are in the group.\nLifetime Purchases of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade = (Lifetime purchase of the primary member) + (Purchases of the secondary member while they are in the group).\nBelow are additional details on ‘Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’\nThe calculation is applicable only for the upgrade strategy on lifetime purchases\nTrackers for the primary member is purchase and visits of the primary member only; purchases or visits of secondary members are not considered\nHowever, rule expressions and tags consider the Lifetime Purchases of the primary member as the purchases of that particular member only and do not include the purchases of secondary members (while they are in the group)\nGroup Lifetime Purchases on Member Care and API is not the same as ‘Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’\nThe transactions of secondary members before joining the group or after leaving the group are not included in the 'Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’\nLifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade includes transactions of a secondary member when the member was in the group. So even if the secondary member leaves the group, his/her transactions when in the group is included in ‘Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’.\nFor example: Primary (P1) and Secondary (S1 and S2)\nT=T0, P1 member does a purchase of Bill 1\nT=T1, S1 member does a purchase of Bill 2 (outside the group)\nT=T2, P1 member forms the group\nT=T3, P1 member does a purchase of Bill 3\nT=T4, S1 joins the group\nT=T5, S2 member makes a purchase of Bill 4 (outside the group)\nT=T6, S2 joins the group\nT=T7, S1 makes a purchase of Bill 5 (within the group)\nT=T8, S1 leaves the group\nT=T9, S2 makes a purchase of Bill 6 (within the group)\nAt T= T9, ‘Lifetime Purchase of Primary Member for Strategy Upgrade’ =\n(Lifetime purchase of primary member i.e. Bill 1 + Bill 3) + (Purchases of secondary members while they are/were in the group i.e. Bill 5 + Bill 6).\nTier upgrade of primary member based on Points and Trackers\nIf the tier is on current points, lifetime points, or tracker values, these values is corresponding to primary member only and do not consider the points/tracker of secondary members.\nFor example: A group has 3 members – P1 (Primary), S1 and S2 (Secondary)\nP1 – Current Points: 500, Lifetime Points: 1,000\nS1 – Current Points: 800, Lifetime Points: 2,000\nS2 – Current Points: 2,000, Lifetime Points: 3,000\nThe upgrade strategy is on lifetime points with Tier 1 to Tier 2 threshold as 2,000 points. so, none of the members will get upgraded as the lifetime points of the primary member is only 1,000.\nTier Downgrade of the primary member\nIf the loyalty program uses purchases in the downgrade strategy, the downgrade calculation for the primary member is (purchases of the primary member) + (purchases done by the secondary member while they are in the group) for the tier duration.\nFor brands using loyalty on user groups, It is recommended to have Purchase or Visits as one of the downgrade criteria so that cumulate purchases by all members get evaluated.\nFor example: Downgrade criteria is set to 12 months from the last slab change date\nThe primary member gets upgraded to a tier on January 07, 2018.\nOn January 31, 2019, while evaluating for downgrade, ‘Purchase’ value for the primary member is (Purchases done by the primary member during Jan 07th, 2018 – Jan 31, 2019) + (Purchases done by secondary members during Jan 07, 2018, – Jan 31, 2019, while they were in the group).\nDowngrade on points earned\nIf a loyalty program uses ‘Earned Points’ in downgrade strategy, these values is corresponding to the primary member only. These values will not include points earned by secondary members.\nFor example: a group has 3 members – P1 (Primary), S1 and S2 (Secondary)\nTier duration – Jan 07, 2018 – Jan 31, 2019\nDowngrade Criteria – Downgrade if ‘Earned Points’ < 1,000\nP1 – points earned during tier duration: 500\nS1 – points earned during tier duration: 1,100\nS2 – points earned during tier duration: 2,000\nIn this case, all the members get downgraded because the primary member doesn’t satisfy the downgrade criteria.\n📘\nTwo additional profiles are present in the system for User Group Loyalty: currentgroupprimary and currentusergroup\nExpire Points for Group / Fleet Users\nA fleet user is a member of a\nfleet loyalty program\n. To enable point expiration for fleet users, enable the\nFLEET_GROUP_LOYALTY_ENABLED\nconfiguration flag and configure the\nFLEET_ENTITY_TYPE\nparameter. Once enabled, points earned by individual users in a fleet will expire based on the expiration conditions.\nTo enable this for an organisation, raise a JIRA ticket to the sustenance team.\nUpdated\n27 days ago\nTable of Contents\nKey Concepts\nDifference between B2B and B2C\nUse Cases\nB2B Loyalty\nB2C Loyalty\nImportant Terminologies\nHow a User Group works\nCreating a User Group\nPoints pooling from secondary members to the primary member\nCommunicating group points to the primary member\nGroup transaction (Add, Update, and Return)\nActions supported for Group Loyalty\nPoints import for the primary member\nTier syncing of secondary members and primary members\nWhen a secondary member joins/leaves the group\nTier upgrade on transactions of group members\nTier upgrade of a secondary member on purchases made of the primary member\nTier Downgrade of secondary members\nTier upgrade of the primary member on lifetime purchases\nTier upgrade of primary member based on Points and Trackers\nTier Downgrade of the primary member\nDowngrade on points earned\nExpire Points for Group / Fleet Users"

These can include activities like registering, updating profiles, etc.\nIn the system, Behavioral Events need to be set up by going to the organisation settings.\nOn this page, you will find all the Behavioral Events already set up in the org in question.\nYou can create a new event by picking from the library of events that Capillary provides or you can create your own new event as well. If you pick from the library, the event will come with the attribute part of the event already set up.\nBut if you want to create your new event, you need to select the attribute from the options available.\nIf the input coming is a free input coming from the source, you can choose \"Enum\", \"Date\", \"String\" or \"Double\" as data type. If the input maps to an existing attribute that Capillary would have in the system, the data type can be taken as \"Product Category\", \"Product SKU\", \"Coupon Code\", etc.\nOther configurations also have to be added to the attribute as required. And you can also check the \"Required\" checkbox to make it a mandatory attribute.\nIn \"Add Destination\", you have to check the Loyalty box (right now Behavioral Events can only be added in Loyalty).\nWhen you create an event, you can see it with a \"Testing Pending\" signal, to publish which, the API in question needs to called and reached successfully. Once the event is published, it will be available for use.\nOnce this is done, you then have to configure the behavioral events in Loyalty. Head to the program in question. As of now, behavioral events are only present in Promotions.\nIn the activity selector, you can search for Behavioral Events. Only the events that are published show up here.\nYou will select the required event and select the program.\nFor Behavioral Events, in Promotion Workflows, in the Points Allocation action, all other parts work similar to Transactional Events but Prorate On works differently. It will only give integer values that need to be selected from the drop down.\nIn the Expression Editor, you can see a host of different options to write the rule based on different attributes in the event itself.\nBehavioural event support for UserGroup2\nAs of now, the behavioural events didn’t work for user groups. The behavioural events would only work for individual customers. Now, behavioural events can be configured for user groups as well.\nThis is possible at the action level. When configuring an action like Points allocation, issue coupons, etc. you will be able to see a drop down to select “individual” or” User group”. On selecting the user group option, that particular action in the behavioural events will work for the groups in your system.\nBelow screenshot helps in understanding:\nAbility to connect behavioral event to a specific card series\nOnce behavioral events are configured, whenever a customer exhibits that behavior, they will be triggered and the customer will get the benefits.\nUntil now, while configuring behavioral events, brands don’t have the ability to create them with respect to card series as an identifier. This became a problem for organizations that are using card series based loyalty programs.\nFrom now, those brands will be able to create behavioral events with respect to card series too. How that works is, while creating the BE, card number will present as an option for identifier type. Using this, even card series based organizations can provide benefits and rewards to their customers based on the card series.\nBehavioral attributes as tags in the communication\nAs mentioned in the beginning, while creating behavioral events brands can configure \"attributes\" depending on their use case. Those attributes help the brands in further finetuning the behavioral activity.\nSome of the most used attributes are Customer ID, Till code, Date, Product SKU, etc. When the behavioral event is triggered for a customer, the configured attributes will get the corresponding data.\nThe best part is, that these \"attributes\" can be used as \"tags\" in the creatives/communication flow of the Loyalty+. As of now, we are supporting \"attributes\" as \"tags\" in the following places only:\nSend SMS\nSend Email\nSend mobile notification\nIn loyalty promotions, when the customer activity is selected as one of the behavioral events of the org, then all the eligible \"attributes\" associated with that particular behavioral event will be available in the above creatives. These attributes will be available as \"tags\" under the \"Generic Events\" of the \"Add Label\" section.\nFor example, the following is a loyalty promotion of the behavioral event (aka AddedToWishlist).\nNow, you can see that there is a section called \"Generic Events\" in the creatives (Send SMS in this case). Now, all the eligible \"attributes\" of this BE are available as \"tags\" in the dropdown.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nBehavioural event support for UserGroup2\nAbility to connect behavioral event to a specific card series\nBehavioral attributes as tags in the communication"

This may be available at a later date and we will notify you when that happens.\nYou can find all details about setting up Referral Campaigns in the article mentioned above. Also, you can use the Expression Editor to use cases like adding limitations to how many transactions from referees can lead to the referrer getting points or how many referees need to start transactions for the referees to get points.\nThe Expression Editor for Referral related actions has two options for rules: Referee Registration Count (refereeRegCount) and Referee Transactions Count (refereeTxnCount). These two rules behave a bit differently. The former gives the number of people that the referrer has given their code to while the latter gives the number of transactions for a particular referee. Accordingly, you can use them to set up your use case.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago"

For example, a car manufacturer and an insurance company can come together to incentivise customers to pick them together.\nSome of the salient features of the coalition program are:\nBrand partnerships to increase customer touchpoints to improve engagement and recall\nEnrollment only via linking APIs\nCan sync with partner tiers based on enrollment or update triggers\nDoes not expire unless a customer is delinked or unsubscribed from the partner's loyalty program\nNo program expiry, generally these contracts are long-term.\nAdd a coalition program\nTo add a subscription program\nFrom the home page, click on the desired program.\nClick\nEdit program\n.\nIn the\nCoalition Program\ntab, click\nAdd coalition program\n.\nIn the\nName\nfield, enter the program's name without blank spaces.\nIn the\nDescription\nbox, enter a brief description of the program.\nClick\nNext\n.\nAdd benefits.

A pure gamification mechanism to increase user retention.\n📘\nNote\nBenefits (aka rewards) needs to be configured seperately (in loyalty promotions) and cannot be configured along with the Milestone.\nIn a Milestone, the target value represents the specific objective or goal that users are required to achieve. This capability empowers brands to gamify their customers' user journey, aiding in user retention, enhancing regular sales, promoting cross-selling, and fostering enriched customer interactions.\nWith the help of Milestones, tracking can be done on almost any aspect of the user. The following examples help in understanding what variant type of tracking can be done using milestones:\nTransactional type of milestones:\nThe user must achieve 10,000 gross sales in a month to receive 100 points.\nThe user has to make 5 transactions in a week to get a premium customer badge.\nThe user has to purchase 5L of petrol of a specific type in a month to get a $5 coupon.\nBehavioral type of milestones:\nThe user must update their profile picture 3 times within a quarter to receive a $10 coupon.\nThe user has to walk 5000 steps in a week to get the fitness-freak badge.\nThe user has to give 3 product reviews in a quarter to get 10k points & exteem user badge.\nExtended fields type of milestones:\nThe user has to purchase $100k as a tax in a year to get the ultra-rich-high-value user badge, which gives exclusive access to company events, and sessions for free.\nThe user has to purchase 13 grams of gold from a specific store in 6 months to get 15k points.\nOther customer activities type of milestones:\nThe user has to redeem the points 5 times in a quarter to get a $2 coupon.\nThe user will be marked with the \"fraud\" label whenever a user does 10 returns in a quarter.\nThe user has to refer 7 new users in a year to get the elite badge and 5k points.\nUnified targets examples:\nWith the help of these, you'll not only be able to track any property of the customer using targets but also will be able to track multiple targets together which has many use cases.\nRefer to\nthis\nto learn more about the unified targets.\nIn all the above examples, each user is assigned a specific \"target\" to achieve to receive corresponding benefits. This process mirrors the structure of a game, where teams or players must meet predefined targets or goals to achieve rewards and others. Thus, milestones help in implementing gamification for your brand.\nAccessing the Milestone configuration page\nTo configure a milestone, use the following direct links to access the Milestones product page:\nMethod 1:\nClicking on the below appropriate links\nEU cluster:\nclick on this link to open the EU cluster.\nIndia cluster:\nclick on this link to open the India cluster.\nAPAC2/SG cluster:\nclick on this link to open the APAC2/SG cluster.\nUSA cluster:\nclick on this link to open the USA cluster.\nNote: On the homepage, make sure to change the \"org\" to your org.\nMethod 2:\nSearch from org settings\nLogin into the homepage of the org where you want to create your milestones\nOn the top-right corner, click on the \"profile\" symbol.\nClick on the \"Organization settings\"\nSearch for \"milestones\", and that's it. You'll be taken to the home page of milestones.\nHome page\nAfter clicking on any of the above URLs depending on your cluster, you'll see the home of Milestones. On the homepage, from the drop-down at the top-left, select your organization to view existing Milestones and configure new Milestones for your organization.\nThe homepage displays a list of all the Milestones already configured for the brand. You can use the search option to search for a Milestone and can also filter the Milestone list  based on:\nThe name of the milestone\nSingle targets or multiple targets (aka unified targets)\nDual status of the milestone\nTimeline based: Live, Upcoming, Ended\nActivity-based: Active, Inactive\nDuration of the milestone (between the start date X - and end date Y)\nKPI on which the milestone is created (Net sales, Gross sales, Quantity, Transactions, etc..)\nThis landing page also provides the following abilities for the user to perform:\nActivate/Deactivate a milestone\nOnce a milestone is deactivated, it will have the \"inactive\" chip & no longer the milestone can track the customers as per its configurations.\nA deactivated milestone can be re-activated again as long as the milestone is not yet over.\nEdit flow of the milestone\nOnce a milestone is created, some aspects of the milestone (rules, scope, target value, etc...)can be edited but not all the items are editable. Click on the pencil icon to enter the edit flow.\nCreating a milestone\nYou can build the milestone from the beginning (build from scratch) or use existing templates.\nBuild from scratch\nThis option can be used if you cannot find a template that suits your requirements. To build a milestone from the beginning, perform the following:\nOn the homepage, click\nNew milestone\n.\nSelect\nBuild from scratch\nand click\nNext\n.\nEnter the following details:\nMilestone details\nMilestone cycle details\nCustomer enrolment/audience details\nTarget details\nClick\nDone\n.\nMilestone details\nEnter the following details:\nName:\nName for the Milestone. Always, try to provide a suitable name depending on your use case. This helps later in easily recognizing your milestone. Remember, the name of the milestone is not editable & so always think twice before providing the name for a milestone. Do not include any spaces at the beginning or end of the name.\nDescription:\nA brief description of your use case. This helps to understand the purpose of Milestone in the future, and this can be edited later.\nDuration:\nStart date & end date for the entire milestone. All the cycles of the milestone should present in this duration, and there could be a buffer between the milestone start date & 1st cycle's start date. Similarly, there could be a buffer between the milestone end date & last cycle's end date.\nThis will be helpful when you want your 1st cycle to start from some future date, but you want to create your milestone today itself. In that case, the milestone start date can be created today & 1st cycle's start date could be some future date. Tracking will only happen during the cycle's duration.\n📘\nA milestone can be created with both start & end date in the past. This helps in creating backdated milestone type of promotions as when required.\nFor example, assume current date is 15th May 2024. On this current date:\nCase 1:\nUser could create a milestone whose start date is 1st Jan 2024, and end date is 1st June 2024. In this case, start date is in the past.\nCase 2:\nUser could create a milestone whose start date is 1st Jan 2024, and end date is 31st march 2024. In this case, both the start & end date are in the past.\nPoints to remember:\nPast transactions/events as per the date of creation of the milestone has to be re-processes again to consider that past date in the tracking of the milestone.\nIn the case of 1st case, all the past data as per milestone's created date (1st Jan 2024 to 14th May 2024) has to be re-processed again for that data to be tracked. Transactions from 15th May 2024 to the end will be tracked automatically.\nIn the case of 2nd case, all the past data as per milestone's created date (1st Jan 2024 to 31st March 2024) has to be re-processed again for that data to be tracked. As the milestone is ending on 31st March, there is nothing that will be tracked automatically here.\nUser can create a past milestone upto 6 months in the past. For any use cases where higher limit is needed, reach out to product team.\nWhen APIs are being used to create past milestones, it may not throw the 6 months validation but be careful when using the APIs directly for compatibility issues.\nThis past type of milestone will work only for the \"immediate benefit rewarding\" type of milestones and won't work for the \"period end rewarding\" cases.\nTill code:\nThis till code is used to attribute all the points that are being given from this milestone to a specific store. If you are a brand that doesn't have the till concept, please create a dummy till and select that here.\nThe target value for the customer:\nYou can either configure it to be the same target for all the customers or a different target for each customer.\nSame target for all customers:\nSelect this option to set the same target value for all the customers. This is generally the most used case.\nThe different targets for each customer:\nSelect this option to assign unique target values to different customers. If selected, a CSV file containing information on target values for each customer needs to be uploaded in the subsequent steps\nNote:\nThe target values are set in the subsequent steps.\nMilestone cycle details\nIn this section, enter the details of the Milestone's cycles. A cycle in the context of milestones represents a recurring period during which users are expected to achieve a specific goal.  For example, if you want your user to achieve $100 gross sales in a month, then the duration of that cycle will be a \"month\".\nFixed period cycle\nIn the fixed period cycle, each cycle runs for a defined period from the selected start date. A maximum of 100 different cycles can be configured. You can either define the same duration for each cycle or define a different duration for each cycle.\nSame duration for each cycle\nIn this, each cycle of the Milestone will have the same duration. The supported cycle durations are Monthly, Quarterly, Half-Yearly, Yearly, Weekly & Daily. Also, all these cycle durations will be in continuous nature without any gap between them.\nTo define the same duration for each cycle, perform the following\nSelect the option\nSame duration for each cycle\nFrom the drop-down, select the duration. The available options are Monthly, Quarterly, Half-yearly, Yearly, Weekly & Daily.\nSelect\nSpecific date\nto select and start the cycle from a specific date. If you select today's date, the cycle starts immediately. This is also called a \"fixed calendar window\"\nThe fixed calendar window works exactly as per the calendar. The day will start at 00:00:000 & end at 23:59:599. For example, if a user created a milestone of fixed calendar window type (with frequency as daily) at 11:00:000, then the 1st cycle will only have 13 hrs for the user as the day ends sharply.\nSelect the option\nAfter customer's 1st transaction post enrolment\nto start the cycle after the customer's first transaction/event within the milestone duration. This is also called a “cyclic calendar window”.\nThe cyclic calendar window works on a \"24 hours\" basis. For the same example as above, if the user made 1st transaction at 11:00:000 (aka milestone starts), then the 1st cycle will extend exactly to 24 hours.\nIn the\nTotal cycles\ntext box, define the number of cycles. The maximum number of cycles supported is 100.\nDifferent duration for each cycle\nThis cycle type is suitable when the predefined cycle durations, such as Monthly or Quarterly, don't align with the brand's campaign strategy. Brands opt for customized cycle durations like weekly or every 10 days. This is supported only for the \"fixed window\" type of milestones, requiring users to manually provide the start and end dates for each cycle as per their use case.\nTo define different durations for each cycle, perform the following\nSelect the option\nDifferent duration for each cycle\n.\nEnter the\nStart date\nand\nEnd date\n.\nTo add more cycles, click\n+Add cycle\n.\nTill target achievement cycle\n(Period agnostic cycle)\n👍\nNote\nThis is applicable only if the target is set as \"same for all customers\" in the Milestone details (aka, the config in the previous step).\nTill target achievement also called a \"period agnostic cycle\" is a type of Milestone cycle where the cycle continues until the user achieves the specified target, and resets again immediately. In this configuration:\nThe Milestone cycle doesn't have a predefined duration. Instead, the cycle runs until the user reaches the specified target or goal. You can also define a maximum number of cycles.\nThe cycle starts after the customer's first transaction within the milestone duration.\nThere is no fixed end date for each cycle; it dynamically adjusts based on individual user achievements.\nThis type of Milestone cycle is particularly useful when the focus is on individual user progress toward a target rather than adhering to fixed time intervals.\nTo define a Till target achievement cycle, perform the following\nSelect\nTill target achievement\n.\nSelect\nMax limit\n, and in the\nTotal Cycles\ntext field, enter the maximum limit of cycle numbers to define the maximum number of cycles. The maximum number of cycles that you can set is 100.\n📘\nMilestone window mapping - fixed window, cyclic window, and period agnostic window\nThese are the terminologies used in the legacy Milestone workflow and this information is provided for familiarisation purposes only.\nFor configuring a fixed calendar window:\nSelect the combination: (Fixed duration - On a specific date) in this new flow.\nFor configuring a cyclic calendar window:\nSelect the combination: (Fixed duration - On the customer's first transaction) in this new flow.\nFor configuring a period agnostic window:\nSelect the combination: (Till target achievement) in this new flow.\nCustomer enrolment details\nThe\ncustomer enrolment\nsection lets you select an\naudience group\nfor the target or milestone. You can choose all registered customers, specific customers using\naudience groups\nor skip adding customers.\nTo apply different target values for each customer, upload a\n.csv\nfile with customer identifiers, cycles, and target values, then map the fields in the UI.\nTo configure the audience group for a target, follow these steps:\nGo to the\nCustomer enrolment\nsection on the\nNew milestone\npage.\nSelect a customer range for the target.\nThe details are as follows:\nCustomer Range\nDescription\nSpecific customers\nInclude specific customers by selecting one or more audience groups  or uploading a\n.csv\nwith their details.\nAll customers\nInclude all registered customers. Newly registered customers will be automatically enrolled into the milestone.\n📘\nNote\nIf you select a\nperiod-agnostic\nduration for the milestone, you can select only\nAll customers\nas the customer range.\nIf you select\nSpecific customers\n, choose an audience type (such as Audience group or Audience with target values) from the\nAdd audience\ndropdown menu.\nThe details are as follows:\nAudience Type\nDescription\nAudience group\nCreate a new audience group\nor select one or more existing audience groups.\nAudience with target values\nUpload a\n.csv\nfile containing the target and sub-target values for each customer. You can download a sample\n.csv\nfile from\nhere\n. This is applicable if you select\nDifferent target value for each cycle\nin the\nTarget value for each cycle will be?\nsection when\ncreating a target\n.\nSelecting an audience group\nUploading a CSV of audience with target values\nSelect\nSkip for now\nto skip audience selection if required. This creates a target group with no enrolled customers. To enrol customers later, use the\nEnrol a customer to a milestone API\n. This is not supported for milestones with a\nperiod-agnostic\nduration.\nCustomers are now added and enrolled in the milestone.\nExample of an advanced audience enrollment:\nA fuel brand  wants to create three different targets. However, they want to enroll their customers into targets depending on the user's performance in some other target.\nTarget 1: The customer must purchase a total of 100L of petrol.\nTarget 2: The customer must purchase a total of 200L of petrol.\nTarget 3: The customer must purchase a total of 300L of petrol.\nThe brand wants to enroll customers in each target as follows:\nTarget 1: All customers\nTarget 2: Only customers those who achieved Target 1.\nTarget 3: Only those customers who achieved Target 2.\nIn the Audience filter (search for \"\ntarget\n\" in the filter search box to use filters based on targets), provide values such as the minimum target value that needs to be achieved, time factor, target name, and cycle name (optional). Based on those values, customers are automatically filtered. See below image:\nFor more information, refer to the documentation on\nAudience group\n.\nTarget details\nA target is a set goal or objective a customer has to achieve within a certain time period to receive benefits.\nThe target value determines the value that a customer needs to achieve within a\ncycle\nor set end date, to receive the associated benefits. For example, if a brand sets a $100 monthly purchase goal to qualify for benefits, $100 is the target value.\nTo configure a target, follow these steps:\nNavigate to the target section on the\nNew milestone\npage.\nSelect the target value behaviour for each cycle using the radio buttons under the\nTarget value for each cycle will be?\nsection. The options available are\nSame target value for each cycle\nand\nDifferent target value for each cycle\nThe details are as follows:\nTarget value\nDescription\nSame target value for each cycle\nTarget value is consistent across all cycles of the milestone. For example, if the number of cycles configured is three and the target value is ₹5000, the target value of ₹5000 applies to all three cycles.\nDifferent target value for each cycle\nDifferent target values can be configured for different cycles of the milestone. For example, if the number of cycles configured is three, multiple target values can be configured for each cycle.\n1st cycle: target value of ₹5000.\n2nd cycle: target value of ₹10,000.\n3rd cycle: target value of ₹15,000.\n📘\nNotes\nThe\nDifferent target value for each cycle\ntarget value is supported for targets that have a\nfixed-calendar window\n.\nThe\nTarget\nsection indicates the number of targets created for the target group. You can add up to 50 targets under a target group.\nSelect the customer activity to achieve the target using the drop down under the\nWhat should the customer do to achieve the target?\nsection. Refer to the section on\nCustomer Activities\nfor more information on the configurations for each type of customer activity.\nSelect a behavioral event if needed by using the\nselect event\ndrop down to choose an event to track. This is applicable for the Behavioral event activity.\nSelect a target / milestone if needed by using the\nSelect milestone\ndrop down to choose a milestone to track. This is applicable for the Milestone achieved activity. Enter a name for the target. The target name is automatically entered from the name assigned to the target group.\nConfigure the target activity KPI and target values under the\nWhat should the customer do to achieve the target?\nsection. Refer to the section on\nTracking Configurations\nfor more information on the configurations for each type of customer activity.\nSelect\n+ Add target values\nto configure the target values for each cycle. This is applicable when selecting\nDifferent target value for each cycle\nas the target value behaviour.\nEnter the target values for each cycle.\nSelect\nSave\nto save the values for each cycle.\nConfigure the scope for the target under the\nScope of <target name>\nsection. Refer to the documentation on\nfilter activity\nfor more information on configuring the scope.\nSelect\n+ Add target\nto add a new target.\nFrom the\nAdding targets\nwindow, select the activity type for the new target under the\nWhat should the customer do to achieve the target?\nsection.\nThe details are as follows:\nActivity type\nDescription\nSame activity for each target\nTarget activity type is consistent across targets. For example, all target activities are transactional events.\nDifferent activity for each target\nDifferent target activity types can be configured for different targets. For example, if the number of targets configured is three, multiple target activities can be configured for each target.\n1st target: Transactional.\n2nd target: Behavioral event.\n3rd target: Earn reward currency.\nSelect the conditions for achieving the target from the drop down.\nAll:\nAll the targets must be completed to qualify for a reward.\nAny:\nAny of the targets must be completed to qualify for a reward.

The table below lists the customer activities that can be tracked for a milestone.\nActivity\nDescription\nExample\nTransaction\nTrack customer purchases, in-store, online, or at a point-of-sale (POS) system.\nA customer purchases a pair of sneakers online or at a store.\nBehavioural event\nTrack customer activities like signing up, changing their profile picture, or adding items to their wish list.\nA customer adds items to their wish list on the app or website.\nEarn reward currency\nTrack the reward currencies (\npoints\nor\nalternate currencies\n) that a customer has earned during a certain period. The configuration for points and alternate currencies  are the same.\nYou can select only one reward currency per target. To track both points and alternate currencies within the same target/milestone, create a\nunified milestone\nwith two or more targets and select points and/or alternate currencies as the reward currencies for each target.\nA customer earns 500 reward points for purchasing a ₹5000 jacket during a promotional event.\nReferrals\nTrack the number of times a customer has successfully referred another person.\nA customer refers a friend using a unique link, and the friend makes the first purchase, earning the customer rewards.\nPoints redemption\nTrack how often customers use their points to redeem rewards, provided redemption is available.\nA customer uses 500 points to redeem a ₹500 discount while purchasing groceries\nCoupon redemption\nTrack the number of times a customer uses coupons to get discounts or benefits.\nA customer applies a 20% discount coupon during checkout in an online store.\nReturning a transaction\nTrack the number of transactions a customer returns, whether a full return or part of the purchase.\nA customer returns a t-shirt purchased online as it did not fit properly.\nUpdating a transaction\nTrack how many times a customer changes details about their previous purchases.\nA customer orders 1kg bananas and 1kg mangoes but later adjusts the order, reducing the mangoes to 500gms after receiving a partial refund.\nUpdating customer profile\nTrack how often a customer updates their personal information on their profile.\nA customer updates their phone number on the app.\nPromised points conversion\nTrack how many times\npromised points\n(temporary or pending rewards) are turned into regular points for the customer.\nMilestone achieved\nTrack how many times a customer completes a target, such as spending a specific amount or completing a behavioral event such as drinking eight litres of water.\nNotes:\nThe following conditions are required to select a milestone/target to track:\n- The milestone/target timeline must be a fixed calendar window.\n- The frequency of the milestone must be lower than the milestone being created. For example, if the milestone being tracked has a frequency of daily, then the milestone being created must have a higher frequency like weekly or monthly.\n- The duration of the milestone must fit within the milestone being created.\n- The milestone must be active.\n- The tracking type must be default or unified. This is also supported for streaks, enabling “third-level tracking” use cases. For example: Brush twice a day, six times a week, for ten weeks in a quarter. Walk 5,000 steps a day, five times a week, for three weeks in a month Refer to the documentation for more information on\nthird-level tracking.\nA customer achieves a milestone by walking 10,000 steps daily for five consecutive days, as part of a fitness challenge.\nPoints redemption reversal\nTrack how many times redeemed points are reversed to the customer due to cancellations or errors.\nA customer cancels a flight ticket they booked using points, and the points are returned to their account.\nTracking Configurations\nYou can configure the target criteria and value based on selected customer activity. The types of customer activities are:\nTransactional activities\nBehavioral events\nEarn reward currency\nOther customer activities\nTransactional Activities\nTrack customer purchases, in-store, online, or at a point-of-sale (POS) system. When a customer makes a transaction that satisfies the conditions set by the target, the customer is rewarded. The KPIs for transactional activities are as follows:\nKey Performance Indicator\nActivity Level\nDescription\nExample\nSupports Entering Decimal Value\nGross Amount\nBill (Transactions) and Line Items\nTrack the total gross sales made by the user during the cycle. Gross sales refer to the total amount before any discounts or offers are applied.\nA customer purchases a product worth ₹2000 without any offers or discounts applied.\nYes\nNet Amount\nBill (Transactions) and Line Items\nTrack the total net sales made by the user during the cycle. Net sales are the final amount paid by the user after discounts or offers.\nA customer purchases a product worth ₹5000 but pays only ₹3000 after a discount is applied.\nYes\nCount\nBill (Transactions)\nTrack the total number of transactions made by the user within a time period.\nA customer makes five separate purchases at an online store during the week.\nNo\nDays of Activity\nBill (Transactions)\nTrack the total number of unique days on which the user made at least one transaction within a time period.\nA customer makes a purchase on three different days in a month.\nNo\nProduct Quantity\nLine Item\nTrack the number of items purchased by the user within a time period. This can be configured to track specific line-items/products.\nA customer buys 12 cans of soda at a store.\nNo\nCount\nLine Items Extended Fields\nTrack how many times a transactional or line-item extended field appears in a transaction.\nA customer purchases three products with the extended-field labeled “Winter Sale”.\nNo\nSum\nLine Items Extended Fields\nTrack the sum of a selected transactional or line-item extended field within a time period.\nA customer purchases products worth ₹5000 with the extended-field labeled \"Summer Sale.\"\nYes\nSum of highest value\nLine Items Extended Fields\nTrack the highest value of a selected transactional or line-item extended field for each day. The highest value is counted and added to the highest values from other days in the tracking period.\nA customer makes three different purchases worth ₹1000, ₹650 and ₹6000. In this case, only the transaction worth ₹6000 is tracked.\nYes\nBehavioral Events\nA behavioural event can be configured as a target when creating a milestone. All the behavioural events configured for the organisation will be available for selection as a target. You can configure how the behavioural event is tracked and evaluated based on certain KPIs. A behavioural event can include an attribute. The attribute of a behavioural event are specific details or entries of the event. For example, the behavioural event \"Added to Cart\" can have the attributes \"price”, \"quantity\", “SKU” etc.\nRefer to the documentation for more information on\nBehavioral Events\n.\nThe following KPIs are supported for tracking behavioural events:\nKey Performance Indicator\nDescription\nExample\nSupports Entering Decimal Value\nCount\nTrack the number of times a behavioural event has been triggered within a time period.\nIf the behavioural event is \"Product Purchased\", the count KPI tracks how many times customers made a purchase within a given time period.\nNo\nDays of activity\nTrack the number of unique days the behavioural event has been triggered within a time period.\nIf the behavioural event is \"Store Visit\", the visit KPI tracks the number of unique days customers visited the store.\nNo\nSum\nTrack the total sum of a specific attribute value within the behavioural event.\nIf the behavioural event is \"Added to Cart\" with the attribute \"price”, the sum KPI tracks the total price of all items added to the cart.\nYes\nSum of highest value\nTracks the highest value of an attribute for each day. The highest value is counted and added to the highest values from other days in the tracking period.\nIf the behavioural event is \"Added to Cart\" with the attribute \"price\", the sum of highest value KPI tracks the highest price of an item added to the cart each day. If a customer adds items priced at ₹1000, ₹4000, and ₹2500 on the same day, only the highest price (₹4000) is counted for that day. This value is then summed with the highest prices from other days during the tracking period.\nYes\nEarn reward currency\nTrack the reward currencies (\npoints\nor\nalternate currencies\n) that a customer has earned during a certain period. For example: An airline tracks the miles (alternate currencies) earned by customers through its loyalty program. Customers can earn miles from both regular flights and special promotional events. A customer flying from India to Singapore can earn 1,000 miles for the flight, while a special promotion offering 2x miles during a holiday sale would allow the customer to earn 2,000 promotional miles. These alternate currencies earned by the customer are tracked by the target.\nThe following KPIs are supported for tracking reward currencies:\nKey Performance Indicator\nDescription\nregular\nNumber of regular points or alternate currencies earned. Regular points or alternate currencies are those earned from a loyalty program.\npromotional\nNumber of promotional points or alternate currencies earned. Promotional points or alternate currencies are those earned within a loyalty promotion.\nboth regular and promotional points\nTotal number of regular and promotional points or alternate currencies earned.\nOther Customer-Level Activities\nTrack the frequency of customer-level activities and events (referred to as customer-level events in the loyalty workflow) that are triggered by the user. These include: referral, points redemption, coupon redemption, return transaction, update transaction, update customer profile, promised points converted, milestone achieved, points redemption reversal.\nThe following KPIs are supported for tracking customer-level activities:\nKey Performance Indicator\nDescription\nCount\nTrack the number of times an event has been triggered within a time period.\nDays of activity\nTrack the number of unique days the behavioural event has been triggered within a time period.\nFilter Activity\nThis section allows you to tailor the Milestones to meet specific needs and use cases for the brand. You can define the scope and filter criteria for the Milestone, ensuring it applies to the desired customer segments and activities.\nScope-Based Filtering:\nStores:\nLimit the Milestone to specific retail locations.\nZones:\nApply the Milestone to defined geographical areas.\nConcepts:\nLimit the milestones to specific Organizational Units (OUs).\nTo define the Milestones for all stores, zones, and concepts, select\nAll stores, zones, and concepts\n.\nTo define the Milestones for a specific store, zone, or concept, select\nSpecific store, zone, and concept\nand then choose the relevant options.\nRule-Based Filtering:\nFor further refinement, you can define specific rules in the rule box. These rules can target particular line items, categories, minimum transaction amounts, etc.\nCategories:\nTarget specific product categories within the Milestone.\nLine Items:\nApply the Milestone to specific products or SKUs.\nTransaction Amount:\nSet minimum or maximum purchase amounts for Milestone progress.\n📘\nNote\nFor line item-related rules, ensure that \"lineitem\" is selected as the target entity. Writing line item-related rules when \"transaction\" is selected as the target entity will lead to errors.\nTender-based rules are not supported in the rule box of milestones. For use cases related to tender-based rules, please reach out to a member of the product team.\nFor more information on writing rules, refer to the\nProfiles documentation\n.\nCreating a sub-target\nSub-targets are smaller goals configured within a larger target. This enables brands to nudge and motivate customers and reward them at smaller intervals during the target journey.\nTo create a sub-target, follow these steps:\nNavigate to the target section of a milestone.\nClick\nAdd sub-target.\nEnter a name for the sub-target.\nSelect the achievement criteria from the drop-down menu\nThe achievement criteria are as follows:\nAchievement criteria\nDescription\nPercentage value\nDefine a percentage of the main target required to achieve the sub-target. This is applicable only for the following\ntransactional activities\n: gross amount (total transaction amount excluding discounts) and  net amount (total transaction amount with discounts applied).\nExample\n: Achieve 20% of the main target to receive a discount coupon.\nAbsolute value\nDefine a specific achievement value required to achieve the sub-target.\nExample:\nAchieve ₹5000 in purchases to to receive a discount coupon\nSelect\nContinue\nto confirm the changes.\nSelect\nDone\nto save the changes.\n📘\nNote\nWhen editing a milestone, the sub-target achievement criteria type cannot be modified, and only the amount can be updated.\nUse case\n:\nConsider a scenario where a brand wants to incentivise customers for purchasing specific accessories at a store. A milestone with a target value of ₹10,000 is set and includes the following sub-targets:\n20% Achievement (₹2000): Send a message acknowledging progress and encouraging further effort.\n50% Achievement (₹5000): Incentivise the customer with a small reward, such as a discount or coupon code, to encourage continued progress.\n100% Achievement (₹10,000): When the full target is reached, grant a substantial reward, such as a free accessory or an exclusive offer.\nThese sub-targets enable the brand to actively engage with customers throughout their journey, providing personalized communication and motivating them with timely rewards.\nCreating milestones using templates\nTemplates are pre-configured milestones based on a pre-defined use case. These templates expedite the milestone creation process by automatically populating essential values for various use cases. As a user, you only need to provide the remaining information.\nNote:\nTemplates for all kinds of use cases might not be available.\nFor example, the following are some of the templates available:\nTemplate on \"Catalyze product sales\nWhenever a brand wants to boost the sales of a particular product using the Milestone, they can choose this milestone template. This template comes pre-filled with all the essential information required to configure and achieve the intended use case. As a brand, your responsibility is to complete the remaining details, such as the number of cycles, dates, etc.\nTemplate on \"Boost customer spend\nThis template is tailor-made to increase customer spending and comes pre-filled with all the necessary information, including rules, filters, etc. As a brand, your task is to fill in the remaining details.\nNote:\nUpon selecting a template, you can also edit the pre-filled data. As a brand, if you wish to change the pre-filled values to other specific values, that option is also available.\nCloning/Duplicating a Milestone\nOnce a Milestone is created, it can be cloned to create another Milestones. This helps the brands in saving time when they are creating similar milestones.\nTo clone a Milestone, hover over the Milestone that you want to clone and click the Duplicate icon.\nFor example:\nA brand 'Jaffna' has created a milestone that a user has to achieve $100 gross sales in a month to get 100 points. For this milestone, they have configured 5 cycles. However, they also want to create another Milestone and the only difference is, this time the brand wants the KPI as $100 net sales.\nHere, as the entire information is the same, now brand can clone the previous milestone and change the KPI from gross sales to net sales.\n📘\nNotes\nCloning can be done only from a Live/Upcoming Milestone.\nWhen the cloning is completed, the \"customer enrollment\" step won't be cloned. Customer enrollment details needs to be entered before saving the clone.\nAdvanced settings of milestones\nThe advanced settings is a page that contains advanced options for the milestone which brands can use to improve their gamification, enable default options, etc... This is how to go to advanced settings:\nWhen the configurer clicks on the \"advanced settings\" on the top-right corner, the following page opens up:\nCurrently, this page contains the following advanced options:\nEnabling leaderboard on each milestone level\nLeaderboard is a concept that brands can use to improve their gamification by creating competition among the users for additional users.\nMore information on the leaderboard can be found\nhere\nCurrently, the following are the 2 APIs that are supported for the leaderboard\nFetching\ntop-N\ncustomers\nFetching the\nrank of a customer across target groups\nViewing a milestone\nThe details of a milestone can be viewed by clicking on the milestone from the list.\nConfiguration\nThe configuration tab displays configuration information of the milestone in view.\nField\nDescription\nMilestone details\nView the name, duration, attributed store till and customer target value\nCycle\nView the cycle start, duration and number of cycles for the milestone. Refer to the\nmilestone cycles\nsection for more information.\nCustomer enrolment\nView details on enrolled customers.\nTarget\nView details of the target attached to the milestone.\nInformation\nThe information tab displays information of the milestone in view.\nField\nDescription\nTarget group ID\nThe ID of the target group attributed to the milestone.\nTarget ID\nThe ID of the targets attributed to the milestone.\nCreated on\nDate the milestone was created.\nCreated by (Role)\nName of the person who created the milestone.\nConfiguring benefits\nThis step involves defining benefits for end-users upon achieving the configured milestone. The configuration is performed by setting up\nLoyalty promotions\n.\nTo create Milestone-related promotions, you need to use the \"target period elapses\" customer activity and define rules based on your Milestones to configure actions such as benefits, communication, etc.\nHow the EMF behaves b/w Milestones & Loyalty promotions\nThe below flow chart provides you with an overview of EMF (Engagement Metric Factor) flow in Capillary and how Milestones and loyalty promotions are connected via EMF.\nIn this flow, the orange line indicates that after milestone evaluation, if necessary, an event will be sent to promotions via EMF.\nThis happens in two ways:\nImmediate effect\n- When a customer's \"target achieved\" surpasses the \"target defined,\" the brand aims to provide benefits immediately. Therefore, an immediate event request will be sent only when \"targetAchieved > targetDefined\" is in this process.\nEnd of the cycle\n- The milestone evaluation for all customers occurs only at the end of the cycle (and point allocation will also happen after the period ends aka the next day). This is similar to a scheduled task that runs after each cycle, triggering an event request. In this approach, an event request is sent even if \"targetAchieved < targetDefined,\" enabling a broader range of use cases with the assistance of rules.\nGenerally, the B2C use cases follow method (1) where instant gratification is required and B2B use cases follow method (2) where instant gratification has no role & the brand wants to wait till the end of the cycle to let their customers achieve as high as possible so that they can be awarded accordingly.\nAs a brand, if you want to enable immediate effect (Immediate effect), make sure the following config is enabled (mark as \"Active\") in your org settings. When this config is enabled, only then, Milestone will send an event request to EMF as soon as a customer's \"target achieved\" is greater than \"target defined\".\nWhen this config is \"Inactive\", no event request will be sent to EMF on immediate basis. By default, this will be in \"Active\" phase.\nOnce the event reaches loyalty promotions through either of the two methods mentioned above, the promotion undergoes evaluation based on the rules, scope, etc., specified in that promotion. After all evaluations are complete, the associated actions, such as awarding points, distributing coupons, communication, etc., will be triggered.\nRules for the Loyalty promotions about Milestones\nThis applies only to targets for which the benefits are not immediately provided.\nPrerequisite\nMake sure that the vertical 'Target Loyalty' is enabled. To add the vertical to enabled verticals, perform the following:\nNavigate to\nOrganisation settings > Master Data Management> Extended Field > Extended Fields Vertical Mapping\n.\nSelect Target Loyalty from Disabled Verticals.\nClick\nadd\nto add it to the Enabled Verticals.\nMake sure the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config is set as \"active\" in the EMF org settings page. Awards will be given to the user (for milestones/streaks) only when this config is set as \"active\". To enable this, visit the \"EMF Configuration\" page of org settings. If the access to the page is not given, write an email to the sustenance team.\nRules\nAll the rules related to milestones come under the \"currentEvent\" profile. This means that the \"currentEvent\" profile has many attributes about Milestones. They are:\ncurrentEvent.targetAchieved\ncurrentEvent.targetDefined\ncurrentEvent.isTargetAchievedEvent\ncurrentEvent.milestoneValueDefined\ncurrentEvent.targetGaps\ncurrentEvent.targetMilestoneTrigger\ncurrentEvent.targetName\ncurrentEvent.targetPeriod\ncurrentEvent.targetAchieved\nThis rule helps in getting the current target achieved value of the customer. Make sure that, you are entering the name of the milestone inside the parenthesis.\nE.g: currentEvent.targetAchieved(\"ABC\")\ncurrentEvent.targetDefined\nThis rule helps in getting the target defined value by the brand for that Milestone. Similar to the above, make sure you are entering the name of the milestone in the parenthesis.\nE.g: currentEvent.targetDefined(\"ABC\")\nFor example, if you write a rule: currentEvent.targetAchieved(\"ABC\")>currentEvent.targetDefined(\"ABC\"), this rule will become true only when the customer's achieved value is more than the defined value.\ncurrentEvent.isTargetAchievedEvent\nThis rule verifies whether the event that came to loyalty promotions (out of 100s of type of events that are possible) is the event that arrives whenever a user achieves the milestone (aka target).\nFor instance, if you've set up a Milestone where a user needs to achieve $1000 in sales from Jan 1st to Jan 20th. If the user reaches this target by Jan 5th, brands have two options:\nInstant Gratification: Provide benefits right away to the customer, which is common in B2C industries.\nEnd-of-Cycle Evaluation: Delays the evaluation until the end of the cycle, allowing customers to achieve more. This approach is common in B2B industries.\nBy including the \"ENABLE_AWARDS_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" rule in the rule box (assuming it's marked as \"Active\" as shown above), benefits will be immediately given to customers when the target is achieved.\nFor example, if you write a rule: (currentEvent.targetAchieved(\"ABC\") > currentEvent.targetDefined(\"ABC\")) && (currentEvent.isTargetAchievedEvent == true), then the benefits will be given immediatley.\nPlease note that, if you want to do the evaluation ONLY at the end of the cycle, you have to make the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" as \"Inactive\" in the EMF configuration page of org settings.\nENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\n(config)\nisTargetAchievedEvent\n(rule expression)\nThe behavior of the EMF\nActive\ntrue\nThe event will come to promotions twice. Once when the targetAchieved > target Defined. Again, at the end of the cycle/period. This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\nThe rule expression becomes true when the targetAchieved > target Defined.\nActive\nfalse\nThe event will come to promotions twice. Once when the targetAchieved > target Defined. Again, at the end of the cycle. This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\nThe rule expression becomes true at the end of the cycle/period.\nActive\nThis rule is not written.\nThe event will come to promotions twice. Once when the targetAchieved > targetDefined. Again, at the end of the cycle. This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\nHowever, because of not writing the rule in the promotions, the evaluation also happens twice. Once when achieved > defined, and again at the end of the cycle.\nSo, a customer will get benefits twice.\nInactive\ntrue\nThe event will come to loyalty at the end of the cycle or period as the config is \"Inactive\". This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\nInactive\nfalse\nThe event will come to loyalty at the end of the cycle or period as the config is \"Inactive\". This means point allocation will happen after the period ends (aka the next day).\ncurrentEvent.targetMilestoneTrigger\nThis rule configures actions for various triggers of the Milestone, such as \"sub-targets.\"\nFor example, if you set a condition that \"a user has to make 1000 gross sales in a month to get 100 points,\" and you also want to send a message when 70% of the target is achieved, you can use sub-targets.\nIf you have created one sub-target named \"ABC1\" at 30% & another sub-target named \"ABC2\" at 60%,  the rule currentEvent.targetMilestoneTrigger.contains(\"ABC1\") will be triggered when 30% is achieved and the rule currentEvent.targetMilestoneTrigger.contains(\"ABC2\") will be triggered when 60% is achieved.\ncurrentEvent.milestoneValueDefined\nThis rule provides the value of the sub-target configured on the total target. For instance, if you set a milestone that \"a user has to make 20 transactions in a quarter to get 100 points\" and configure a sub-target at 80% of the total target, this rule can be useful. Suppose a user has made 18 transactions in that quarter. A sub-target event will be sent to loyalty promotions from the milestones as the sub-target has been achieved.\nIn the event evaluation, the rule\ncurrentEvent.milestoneValueDefined\nwill return the value as 16 (80% of 20 is 16, the sub-target value). Brands can use this rule to achieve various use cases where the sub-target value is needed in their strategy.\ncurrentEvent.targetGaps\nThis rule returns the difference between the \"targetDefined\" and \"targetAchieved\" values of the customer. Use this rule to address use cases where strategic decisions need to be made based on gaps.\nFor example, writing the rule currentEvent.targetGaps(\"ABC\") where \"ABC\" is the name of the milestone will return the difference between these values. If user 'X' has achieved a target value of 700 while the defined value is 500, this rule will return the gap between those values.\ncurrentEvent.targetName\nThis rule enables the creation of rules based on the names of milestones. For instance, as a brand, if you want to execute specific actions for a particular milestone, you can use this rule.\nFor example, if you have a milestone named \"ABC\" and you wish to perform specific actions exclusively for this milestone, you can utilize the rule\ncurrentEvent.targetName.contains(\"ABC\")\n.\ncurrentEvent.targetPeriod\nThis rule enables you to execute specific actions or implement particular strategies based on the name of the period. For instance, if you have a milestone named \"ABC\" with three periods—'X', 'Y', 'Z'—you may want to perform certain actions when the event for the period 'X' is sent to loyalty promotions. This rule,\ncurrentEvent.targetPeriod.contains(\"X\")\n, helps you achieve that.\nNote:\nThe target names and period names are unique across the entire organization, eliminating any duplication issues.\nSample use cases & their configuration\nUse case 1: Instant benefit delivery\nStep 1:\nSet the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Active\".\nStep 2:\nConfigure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\nResult:\nWhen a customer's \"targetAchieved\" exceeds \"targetDefined,\" an event is sent to loyalty promotions, triggering configured actions.\nUse Case 2: Delayed benefits at the end of the cycle\nStep 1:\nSet the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Inactive\".\nStep 2:\nConfigure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\nResult:\nAt the end of each cycle, an automated process will run, sending an event to the loyalty promotions for all customers associated with the milestones. Subsequently, the loyalty promotions module will assess the rules and activate the pre-configured actions.\nUse Case 3: Sending a message at the end of a cycle\nStep 1:\nSet the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Inactive\".\nStep 2:\nConfigure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\nResult:\nAt the end of each cycle, a message will be sent to all the customers.\nUse Case 4: Sending message immediately on achieving the target\nStep 1:\nSet the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Active\".\nStep 2:\nConfigure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\nResult:\nA message will be sent immediately once the achieved value is more than the defined target value.\nUse Case 5: Configuring two targets in a single promotion\nThe \"immediate effect\" method is used here.  Make the necessary config & rule change for the \"end of cycle\" method, keeping the targetName rule intact.\nStep 1:\nSet the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Active\".\nStep 2:\nConfigure the rules in the loyalty promotions.\nResult:\nTwo milestones (ABC & XYZ) are defined and both of them are configured in a single promotion.\n🚧\nWarning\nHaving two milestones (ABC & XYZ) configured in a single promotion creates a challenge for auditing. It becomes difficult to determine the points allocated to each milestone as a liability.\nUse Case 6: Configuring sub-Target actions\nA brand configured a sub-target, that at 70% of the target achievement, they want to send a communication to their users.\nA sub-target at 70% should be created first in the Milestone to achieve this use case.\nStep 1:\nSet the \"ENABLE_AWARD_WHEN_TARGET_ACHIEVED\" config to \"Active\" or \"Inactive' as required.\nStep 2:\nConfigure the rules in the loyalty promotions as follows:\nIn this case, the rule becomes \"true\" when the customer achieves 70% of the target, indicating the fulfillment of the sub-target. The configuration settings determine whether sub-target actions take effect immediately or at the end of the period.\n👍\nNote\nThe above usecases are some of the examples only. You can configure and achieve more usecases using these rules. Read the document and use cases properly before configuring the Mielstones.\nAlso, note that the adjustment of target-value upon return transaction work only when the \"ALLOW_RETURN_ON_TARGET\" config is enabled as true in the EMF configurations.\nConfiguring Milestone Settings\nYou can configure how customers’ progress toward a\nmilestone\nor\nstreak\nis tracked and adjusted in scenarios such as returns, cancellations, or mid-cycle enrolment. These configurations ensure fairness and accuracy in reward eligibility.\nAccessing the Milestone settings page\nTo access the Milestones settings page, follow these steps:\nNavigate to the milestones listing page\n.\nSelect the\nicon in the upper-right corner.\nYou can configure the following settings:\nAdjust milestone values in subsequent cycles due to returned transactions:\nAdjust milestone values when the entire bill is returned\nAdjust milestone values when line items are returned\nSet buffer periods for retro transactions\nInclude past transactions and behavioural events when a customer enrols in a milestone mid-cycle\nEnable leaderboards for all milestones\nAdjust milestone values in subsequent cycles due to returned transactions\nAdjust milestone values when the entire bill is returned\nYou can define how the system adjusts milestone values and progress after a customer returns or cancels an entire purchase.\nFor example, a milestone is configured as follows:\nEarn 100 points for a monthly spend of ₹5,000.\nThe milestone has a monthly cycle, meaning the progress resets on the 1st of every month.\nA customer does the following:\nMakes three purchases in January: ₹2,000, ₹1,500, and ₹3,000. They become eligible to earn 100 points after the third purchase.\nReturns the product worth ₹3,000 on 31st of January.\nThe following happens based on the settings configured:\nWhen the setting is disabled\n, the milestone values and earned points are not adjusted for returns in any cycle.\nWhen the setting is enabled\n, the earned points are not deducted in the current cycle (January). In the subsequent cycle (February), the milestone starts at a negative (-) ₹3,000 for the customer. The customer must spend ₹8,000 (₹5,000 + ₹3,000) to be eligible to earn points in February.\nWhen “Adjust milestone values in subsequent period/cycle within milestone” is enabled\nTo enable adjusting milestone values in subsequent cycles due to returned transactions, follow these steps:\nAccess the milestones settings page\n.\nEnable the toggle under\nAdjust milestone values in subsequent period/cycle within milestone group\nSelect\nSave\nto save the changes.\nThe setting now applies for all milestones in the organisation.\nAdjust milestone values when line items are returned\nFor\nline-item-based milestones\n, you can choose how the system adjusts the milestone value when a customer returns a single or multiple line items (not the entire bill).\nFor example, a milestone is configured as follows:\nEarn 100 points for a monthly spend of ₹5,000.\nThe milestone has a monthly cycle, meaning the progress resets on the 1st of every month.\nA customer does the following:\nPurchases the following items in January:\n2 yoga mats: ₹2,000 (₹1,000 each)\n2 water bottles: ₹1,500 (₹750 each)\n1 pair of shoes: ₹3,000\nReturns the following items on 31st of January:\n1 yoga mat (₹1,000)\n1 water bottle (₹750)\nTotal Returned: ₹1,750\nThe following happens based on the settings configured:\nProrate as per line item amount and adjust milestone value:\nThe value is proportionally adjusted based on the total bill amount.\nThe returned amount (₹1,750) represents 26.9% of the original purchase total (₹6,500).\nThe system prorates this ratio against the ₹5,000 milestone target:\n₹5,000 × 26.9% = ₹1,346.15 adjustment.\nIn February, the customer’s milestone progress starts at -₹1,346.15, requiring them to spend ₹6,346.15 (₹5,000 + ₹1,346.15) to earn points.\nDo not adjust milestone value:\nThe return is ignored, and the milestone value is not adjusted.\nTo configure adjusting milestone values in subsequent cycles due to returned transactions for line items, follow these steps:\nAccess the milestones settings page\n.\nSelect the appropriate radio button under\nFor line item based milestones, if return is on transaction amount\n.\nSelect\nSave\nto save the changes.\nThe setting now applies for all milestones in the organisation.\nSet buffer periods for retro transactions\nYou can define a buffer period for including past customer purchases in milestone calculations. To ensure fair awarding of points, the system considers transactions from the previous cycle based on the buffer time configured.\nFor example, a milestone is configured as follows:\nEarn 100 points for a monthly spend of ₹5,000.\nThe milestone has a monthly cycle, meaning the progress resets on the 1st of every month.\nA customer does the following:\nMakes a purchase on 31st January worth ₹5,000 and is eligible to earn points on the purchase.\nThe system has a three-day delay in recording transactions.\nThe transaction is recorded on February 3rd.\nThe following happens based on the settings configured:\nIf the value is set to\n5 days\n, the system will consider transactions made in the previous cycle, up to 5 days.\nWhen “Offset days for sales calculation” is > 0\nTo configure the buffer period, follow these steps:\nAccess the milestones settings page\n.\nEnter the number of days under\nWhat is the delay in sync between Sales data and Capillary platform?\n.\nSelect\nSave\nto save the changes.\nThe setting now applies for all milestones in the organisation.\nInclude past transactions and behavioural events when a customer enrols in a milestone mid-cycle\nYou can choose whether to include a customer’s past activity when they enrol mid-cycle. By default, when the setting is disabled, past activities for a customer are included when the enrol into a milestone in-between a\ncycle\ndue to various reasons.\nFor example, a milestone is configured as follows:\nEarn 100 points for a monthly spend of ₹5,000.\nThe milestone has a monthly cycle, meaning the progress resets on the 1st of every month.\nA customer does the following:\nMakes a purchase on the 1st of February worth ₹2,000.\nEnrolled into a milestone on the 10th of February.\nThe following happens based on the settings configured:\nWhen the setting is disabled\n, the previous transactional and\nbehavioural events\nare considered, and the progress is added to the milestone. This is the default behaviour.\nWhen the setting is enabled\n, the previous transactional and\nbehavioural events\nare not considered, and the progress is not added.\nCustomer activities\n(transactional and behavioural events) will begin tracking from the enrolment date.\nWhen “Track customer activity from their enrolment date” is disabled\nTo enable excluding past transactions and behavioural events when a customer enrols in a milestone mid-cycle, follow these steps:\nAccess the milestones settings page\n.\nEnable the toggle under\nTrack customer activity from their enrolment date\nSelect\nSave\nto save the changes.\nThe setting now applies for all milestones in the organisation.\nEnable leaderboards for all milestones\nYou can enable leaderboards tracking for all configured milestones.\nTo enable leaderboards for milestones, follow these steps:\nAccess the milestones settings page\n.\nEnable the toggle under\nLeaderboard for milestone\nSelect\nSave\nto save the changes.\nThe setting now applies for all milestones in the organisation.\nRefer to the document on\nleaderboards\nfor more information on leaderboards for milestones.\nUpdated\nabout 12 hours ago\nTable of Contents\nAccessing the Milestone configuration page\nHome page\nCreating a milestone\nBuild from scratch\nCreating milestones using templates\nCloning/Duplicating a Milestone\nAdvanced settings of milestones\nViewing a milestone\nConfiguring benefits\nHow the EMF behaves b/w Milestones & Loyalty promotions\nRules for the Loyalty promotions about Milestones\nPrerequisite\nRules\nSample use cases & their configuration\nConfiguring Milestone Settings\nAdjust milestone values in subsequent cycles due to returned transactions\nSet buffer periods for retro transactions\nInclude past transactions and behavioural events when a customer enrols in a milestone mid-cycle\nEnable leaderboards for all milestones"

This enables brands to configure multiple targets in a single milestone for their customers, and reward them for achieving all the targets. Unified targets help brands improve their sales across verticals, across categories, and sales across a specific category by giving customers various targets.\nComponents of a unified target\nA unified milestone primarily consists of the following:\nMultiple targets (at least 2 targets need to be present)\nA logical operator (ALL or ANY) between the specified targets. Users can choose ALL or ANY, but not a mix between the targets.\nAn overall target if a brand desires (currently supported only for the ALL operator & transaction type activity ).\nSupported only for fixed calendar window (aka only when the \"start date of the first cycle\" is specified explicitly by the brand)\n📘\nNote\nA maximum limit of 10 targets can be created in a unified milestone.\nUse case 1\nXYZ, a leading conglomerate, operates across various sectors, including electronics, fashion, groceries, medicines, and more. Customers enjoy unique benefits by engaging in cross-vertical purchases, including:\nBuying any two electronic items from the electronics vertical.\nMaking a minimum jewelry purchase of $1000 from the fashion vertical.\nCompleting five transactions, each amounting to a minimum of $10, within the e-commerce vertical.\nUpon reaching the specified targets, users can redeem a $30 coupon.\nUse case 2\nA customer of a fuel brand can earn rewards by meeting specific purchase targets, which include:\nBuying a minimum of 5 liters of a specified quality of petrol.\nMaking purchases in the food & beverages category totaling at least $30.\nUpon successfully achieving these targets within a specified timeframe, the user is eligible to receive 300 points as a reward.\nUse case 3\nTo meet the target set by a renowned electronics brand, a user is required to:\nBuy electronics with a minimum total value of $600, fulfilling all of the following conditions:\nPurchase heavy electronics amounting to $150.\nConduct 5 transactions, each valued at a minimum of $30.\nMake 3 visits, each with a minimum expenditure of $50.\nPurchase any combination of 5 electronic items.\nCreating a unified target\nTo create a unified target, navigate to the Milestone page and follow a process similar to\ncreating a regular Milestone\n. However, for unified targets, do the following in the \"target activity\" step:\nChoose the\nSame target value for each cycle\noption.\nYou'll see a section asking for details about a single target.\nConfigure the KPI on which the single target needs to be created.\nFrom the drop-down set the scope of the target (like rules, stores, zones, etc..)\nTo add another target, click\nAdd target.\nEnter the details of the second target.\nToggle the slider to enable\nOverall target\n. The Overall target is applicable only when the activity is a \"\ntransaction type\n\" for all the targets and \"\nall\n\" the targets need to be achieved. This is optional and applies to scenarios such as\nUse case 3\nwhere you have an overall target and individual targets with \"all\" as a condition between them. The Overall target option cannot be used with the operator \"ANY\".\nBy default, when you add a new target, \"ALL\" will be configured between them. However, from the drop-down, choose\nAll\nor\nANY\nto define the target conditions that need to be achieved. Select  ALL for scenarios such as\nUse case 2\nor select ANY and define the number of targets that need to be achieved if only a certain number of the defined targets need to be achieved.\nClick\nContinue\n. You cannot add a sub-target for a unified target.\nClick\nDone\n. A unified target has been successfully created.\n📘\nBenefits can be given for unified targets in the following ways:\nFor the whole unified target achievement\nFor the achievement of an individual target inside the unified target\nExample:\nSay, there is an unified target called \"ABC\" that has 3 targets (X, Y, Z) in it.\nX: User has to purchase $100 in a month\nY: User has to make 3 transactions in a month\nZ: User has to update profile picture 2 times in a month\nHere, say the rewarding is:\nIf user achieves ANY(2) of the 3, will get 500 points. However, the brand also wants to reward 100 points whenever the user achieves individual target also.\nFor the unified achievement, write the rule \"currentEvent.isUnifiedTargetAchievedEvent\" in the rule-box on the promotions side. Add the \"issue points\" action by selecting the 'unified target' as the response for the 'target(s)' after selecting the correct option (aka 'ABC' here) in 'Milestones/Streaks' drop-down.\nIn the unified achievement case, pro-rate won't work as there is no source value.\nFor the achievement of individual targets inside the unified targe, follow the exact rules that we write for normal targets & just make sure you are providing the correct name. For example, to configure the benefit of 100 points for 'X' target which is present inside the unified target:\nWrite the rule currentEvent.targetExists(\"X\") && (currentEvent.targetAchieved(\"X\")>=currentEvent.targetDefined(\"X\")) in the rule-box.\nThis time, select the specific target (aka 'X' here) in the 'Target(s)' drop-down after selecting the correct option (aka 'ABC' here) in the 'Milestones/Streaks' drop-down.\nIn this case, pro-rated also will work as there is a source value.\nUpdated\n6 months ago\nTable of Contents\nComponents of a unified target\nUse case 1\nUse case 2\nUse case 3\nCreating a unified target"

Contact your CSM to enable alternate currencies for your organisation.\nAlternate Currencies are a variation of the\nreward currencies (points)\n. Some of the prominent features of alternate currencies are:\nThey can have an image associated with them (for example, a stamp image for the stamp currency).\nThese can be made active or inactive as per the use case.\nOperates at the program level rather than the organization level.\nExample\nIn the E-commerce, Gaming, or Entertainment sectors, brands often offer various incentives such as stars, stamps, boosts, and more to engage their customers. These currencies serve specific purposes, including exchanging stamps for reward catalog items and using boosts to advance to the next level.\nA high-level view of the incentives with these Alternate Currencies looks like below:\nAlternate Currencies can be also provided along with other incentives such as points, coupons, and badges during a transaction. For instance, in the airline industry, you may wish to reward customers with regular points equivalent to 3% of their transaction value. If a customer spends $1000, they would receive 30 regular points.\nHowever, suppose your brand strategy dictates that regular points should not be used for tier-related activities like upgrades or downgrades. In that case, you might introduce a new currency called \"tier points\" for such purposes.\nFor example, if you decide to allocate 5% of these \"Alternate Currencies,\" also known as \"tier points,\" per transaction, the customer would earn 50 tier points alongside their regular points.\nCreating Alternate Currency\nTo create Alternate Currencies, perform the following steps:\nGo to the loyalty program in which the currency needs to be created.\nClick\nEdit program\nif not already in the edit flow.\nClick\nAdvanced settings\n.\nClick\nReward currencies\n.\nClick the\nNew reward currency\nCTA.\nEnter the required details needed to create the currency:\nName of the new currency\nDescription of the new currency\nActivate/Deactivate: Similar to promotions, an active/inactive status can be assigned to Alternate Currencies. This is an editable feature, so this can be updated as & when needed.\nDuration: By default, currency is valid from the date of creation to 99 years. However, a custom duration can also be configured depending on the use case. This can be helpful when the brand wants to allocate alternate currency only during a specific duration.\nImage: Each Alternate Currency must be assigned an image, which will serve as a symbol of the currency. For example, you can upload a stamp image when creating a stamp alternate currency.\nRedeemability of Alternate Currency: If a brand desires, the redeemable property of the currency can be revoked, making it non-redeemable. This is an irreversible property once created, and currently not supported.\nReturn of Alternate currency: If a brand desires, the return property (return & return re-evaluation) can be revoked for an alternate currency. This is an irreversible property once created.\nReward currency conversion: Similar to the feature in points, each Alternate Currency can also be assigned a conversion value. This is valid only when the redeemability is enabled for the currency.\nClick\nDone\n.\nViewing Alternate Currencies\nUpon creation, an Alternate Currency appears immediately on the listing page. To view, navigate to Loyalty program > Edit program > Advanced settings > Reward currencies.\nThis listing page displays Alternate Currency with the below information:\nName, Image uploaded, and Created by.\nStatus & duration.\nIf the currency is redeemable or not, and returnable or not.\nLast updated by\nAlternate Currencies in MLP\nAlternate Currencies are created at the program level and their entire life cycle exists within the program itself.\nFor instance, consider an MLP organization called ABC, which comprises five distinct programs established based on different verticals of operation:\nFashion (fashion vertical)\nElectro (electronics vertical)\nGrocer (groceries vertical)\nHosp (hospitality vertical)\nSport (sports vertical)\nNow, if the brand introduces an Alternate Currency named 'boosts' within the Sport program, the users earn these boosts through purchases from Sport, and they can only utilize them within the Sport program.\nDistribution of Alternate Currencies\nSince Alternate Currencies function in parallel with points, brands can distribute them like points through loyalty programs & loyalty promotions. These can't distributed through Engage+ as of now.\nAlternate currencies can be distributed from both loyalty programs & loyalty promotions. In the actions, the brand can find \"Issue {{AC name}}\" actions for all the ACs configured in the program. The behavior of this action will be similar to \"transaction point allocation\" for transaction-based activity, \"allocation of points\" for behavioral event-based activity, and \"target point allocation\" for milestone/streak related activity.\nAlternate currencies can be issued for customer activities such as AddTransaction, Milestone/Streak is updated (also called as Target period elapsed), and Generic events.\nThe conditions (Earn, Expiry, Return) configured for points can also be applied to the distribution of Alternate Currencies.\nDelayed strategies (aka promised points strategies) that we currently support for points are not supported for alternate currencies.\n📘\nOnce the support of redemption is available for ACs, then the redemption conditions created for points can be used for alternate currencies as well.\nExample\nSuppose a brand has established an Alternate Currency named \"tier points\" and wishes to allocate these points to customers for various activities. This can be accomplished as follows:\nHere, similar to points, the necessary earn condition, expiry condition, etc., must be selected according to the use case. Once these selections are made and saved, they begin to appear in the actions.\nAlternate Currencies in Tracker: managing double liability\nConsider a brand running a promotion offering 5%, 10%, and 15% points to customers categorized as bronze, silver, and gold. Reusing the same points for tier-related actions, such as upgrades or downgrades, poses a double liability risk. This arises because:\nUsers can redeem the points.\nUsers can utilize the same points to upgrade to another tier, increasing the brand's liability further.\nTo address this challenge, you can create an Alternate Currency and a tracker to monitor and minimize double liability concerns. For example, for the above use case, you can create an Alternate Currency 'Tier Points' and track the entity.\nSome important points regarding ACs in trackers:\nTrackers created on alternate currencies won't be available in the tracker set/points tracker set.\nThey can be accessed directly from any set using the following rules:\ncurrentCustomer.trackerValueBeforeEvent(\"Tracker name\", \"Case name\") ><= Value: This rule will fetch the value of the tracker for the user excluding the current event.\ncurrentCustomer.trackerValueCurrentEvent(\"Tracker name\", \"Case name\") ><= Value: This rule will fetch the value of the tracker for the user including the earnings from the current event until before set.\nAs these trackers are not tightly coupled with tracker set/points tracker set, the above rules can be written in loyalty promotion also. This means that tracker information can be accessed from promotions also which was not possible before.\nTo create a tracker based on alternate currency:\nLogin to your respective org\nClick on the 9-dot symbols in the top-left corner\nClick on Loyalty+\nClick on your loyalty program\nClick on \"Edit program\"\nGo to the \"Trackers\" section in the workflow\nClick on \"Add new tracker\".\nWhen you do the above, the following screen appears.\nIn this, all the configs of trackers will work as it is.\nHowever, to create a tracker based on an alternate currency, the corresponding currency has to be selected in the tracked entity. Say, there are 2 alternate currencies (stars, tier points) present in your program:\nThen both the stars & tier points will appear as options in the \"tracked entity\"\nClick on \"Save\" to create the tracker\nTracker based on alternate currencies in workflows:\nOnce a tracker based on alternate currency is created successfully, it can be used right away in workflows. One important differentiation between these trackers from normal trackers is, that there is no need to go to the \"Trackers\" or \"Points Tracker\" section in the workflow to use them.\nRather, these trackers can be used in the normal sets directly making them very flexible. All the tracker rules that are currently supported for trackers will be supported for the trackers based on alternate currencies too.\nTrackers based on alternate currencies in tier settings.\nOnce a tracker based on alternate currency is created successfully, the same tracker can be used in tier settings as well to configure the upgrade/downgrade/renew conditions.\nFor example, say as a brand you have created an alternate currency called \"tier-points\" and you want to do all the tier-related activities based on this currency. To achieve this\nCreate a tracker based on alternate currency\nOnce it is created successfully, go to the appropriate.\nSelect the above tracker in the tracker-based tier-settings configurations\nDone\nPreview of using the above tracker for tier eligibility:\nPreview of using the above tracker for renewal check:\nAlternate currencies in MLP\nAlternate currencies will be created on the program level. This means that, when an alternate currency is created inside a loyalty program, its entire life cycle exists within the program only.\nFor example, say there is an MLP org (Tapa, a conglomerate) that contains 5 programs:\nFrona (fashion vertical)\nErona (electronics vertical)\nGrona (groceries vertical)\nHrona (hospitality vertical)\nSrona (sports vertical)\nNow, whenever an alternate currency (say Pebble) is created in Frona, it can be used only in Frona. This means:\nRedemption of the Pebble is possible only in Frona.\nTrackers can be created based on Pebble only in Frona.\nA new alternate currency called \"Pebble\" can be created in other orgs with the same name, but all of them work independently & confined only to their respective orgs.\nAlternate currencies information in APIs\nOnce an alternate currency is created, and distributed via workflows/promotions, then the information of them will be available in the following APIs.\ngetCustomerLedgerInfo:\nLink\ngetLedgerExplodeInfo:\nLink\ngetCustomerLedgerBalance:\nLink\ngetCustomerDetails V2:\nLink\ngetTransactions V2:\nLink\n📘\nThe information of alternate\n📘\nNotes\nAlternate currency information is stored behind query parameters. This approach aims to maintain lightweight and fast APIs.\nFAQs\nDoes an alternate currency have all the capabilities of points?\nCurrently, alternate currencies can be created, distributed, returned, return re-evaluated, and can be tracked using the trackers. However, many core properties like expiry and redemption won't work with them.\nHow many alternate currencies can I have?\nAlternate currencies work on the program level. In each program, a brand can have up to 5 active alternate currencies. If a brand has use cases where more than 5 are needed, reach out to the product team.\nCan I distribute alternate currencies from any customer activities?\nYes, these can be distributed from any customer activity like add transaction, target completed, generic events, etc. making the distribution seamless & universal.\nAre event notifications supported for Streaks?\nYes, streak supports 6 event notifications. Following are the:\nStreak start\nStreak end\nEnrolment into streak\nUn-enrolment into streak\nStreak-level achieved\nStreak-level unachieved\nUpdated\n2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nCreating Alternate Currency\nViewing Alternate Currencies\nAlternate Currencies in MLP\nDistribution of Alternate Currencies\nAlternate Currencies in Tracker: managing double liability\nAlternate currencies in MLP\nAlternate currencies information in APIs\nFAQs"

The concept of a streak emphasizes the continuity and consistency of customer behavior over time, often leading to rewards or incentives from the loyalty program.\nFor example, in a retail loyalty program, a streak may involve a customer making purchases on consecutive days, weeks, or months. Each consecutive action contributes to the customer's streak, and as the streak continues, the customer may unlock additional rewards, bonuses, or higher loyalty tiers.\nFor any brand, having a large loyal customer base is an advantage. A loyal customer base can help you create a recurring revenue flow, a reputation in the market, an organic way of getting new users because of strong word-of-mouth, etc... We have many capabilities like loyalty promotions, milestones, campaigns, etc... to achieve that.\nSome of the popular streak use cases present in the market:\nStreak in social media apps:\nA user has to share a story or post every day to maintain streak value. The higher the streak value, the more bragging visibility it gives to the user.\nStreaks in education apps:\nA user has to learn continuously / qualify in a test continuously to earn rewards.\nStreaks in e-commerce:\nA user has to open the app 10 times a week for 4 weeks to get 10 points. A user has to provide 1 review in a month for 6 months to get exclusive access to rewards.\nStreaks in health & fitness:\nA user has to walk 5k steps in a day for 10 days to get 1% off on insurance premiums. A user has to drink 3 liters of water per day for 30 days to get 100 points.\nand many many more.\nWith the Streaks feature in Capillary loyalty programs, you can give some specific tasks to your users and make them do them continuously to get the rewards. This will lead to:\nA user base that does specified activity (like purchases, interactions, etc..) continuously.\nA recurring source of revenue\nIncreased user retention.\nSample streak use cases in loyalty\nA user has to purchase 1000 gross sales from the electronics category in a week. If the user does this continuously for five weeks, 10 weeks, and 15 weeks, then the user will get 10, 50, and 100 points.\nA user has to log into the brand's mobile application five times a month from their mobile. If the user does this continuously for three months or five months, then the user will get a $2, or $5 coupon.\nA user has to refer three new customers in a quarter. If the user does this continuously for two quarters or three quarters, then the user will get a silver badge or a gold badge.\nA user has to drink at least one coffee (say Espresso) every day. If the user does this for five days, 10 days, or 15 days continuously, then the user will get 5 stars, 10 stars, and 15 stars.\nStreaks Vs Milestones\nStreaks and Milestones are both powerful gamification capabilities that share common advantages such as increasing user retention, revenue, cross-sales, and incentivization. However, they differ significantly in how they reward a user. Therefore, understanding when to use each capability is essential.\nStreaks\nMilestones\nGamification capability whose main advantage is to create a consistent user base that does some activity \"continuously\".\nGamification capability whose main advantage is to help in increasing \"user retention\".\nSupports only fixed window type of use cases.\nSupports fixed window, cyclic window, and period agnostic use cases.\nNot available in the base package.\nAvailable in the base package.\nStreaks work across cycles. This means the user has to do something continuously across cycles.\nMilestones work on the cycle level. So users can achieve them independently.\nUpdated\n11 months ago\nTable of Contents\nSample streak use cases in loyalty\nStreaks Vs Milestones"

To enable, contact your CSR.\nLogin into the homepage of the org where you want to create streaks\nClick on the \"profile\" icon on the top-right corner.\nClick on the \"Organization settings\".\nSearch for \"Streaks\", that's it. You'll be taken to the home page of the streaks.\nStreaks home page\nThis is how the Streak home page appears.\nThis is the Streaks landing page, where all existing streaks are visible. Brands can search for a specific streak using the following criteria:\nName of the streak\nDuration of the streak: Brings all the streaks that are falling in the given start & end date.\nStatus of the streak: There can be 2 types of status\nTimeline based: Live, Upcoming, Ended\nActivity-based: Active, Inactive\nThis landing page also provides the following capabilities against each streak:\nActivate/Deactivate: A streak can be activated/deactivated depending on the use case by clicking on the 3-dot symbol at the end of each row.\nEdit flow of the flow: Once a streak is created, certain components of the streak (like scope, rule, etc...) can be edited by clicking on the \"pencil\" icon at the end of the row.\nCreating streak\nTo create a new streak, on the home page, click\nNew streak\nand enter the below details:\nBasic details\nCustomer enrolment details\nActivity details\nBasic details\nIn the\nBasic details\nsection, define the following:\nName\n- Name of the streak. Always provide a suitable name (related to your use case) as it helps in searching for the streaks easily in the future.\nDescription\n- A short description of the streak. Always provide a suitable description as it helps in understanding the purpose of the streak in the future.\nDuration\n: Duration for which the Streaks need to be active & running.\nFor example, a brand wants to run a weekly streak, requiring its users to make three weekly transactions. If a user accomplishes this for five, ten, and fifteen consecutive weeks, they will receive 10, 20, and 30 points respectively.\nIf the brand intends to start this streak on January 10th, 2023, the start date is defined as January 10th, 2023, and the end date is 15 weeks from January 10th, 2023.\n📘\nA streak can be created with both start & end date in the past. This helps in creating backdated streak type of promotions as when required.\nFor example, assume current date is 15th May 2024. On this current date:\nCase 1:\nUser could create a streak whose start date is 1st Jan 2024, and end date is 1st June 2024. In this case, start date is in the past.\nCase 2:\nUser could create a streak whose start date is 1st Jan 2024, and end date is 31st march 2024. In this case, both the start & end date are in the past.\nPoints to remember:\nPast transactions/events as per the date of creation of the streak has to be re-processes again to consider that past date in the tracking of the streak.\nIn the case of 1st case, all the past data as per streak's created date (1st Jan 2024 to 14th May 2024) has to be re-processed again for that data to be tracked. Transactions from 15th May 2024 to the end will be tracked automatically.\nIn the case of 2nd case, all the past data as per streak's created date (1st Jan 2024 to 31st March 2024) has to be re-processed again for that data to be tracked. As the streak is ending on 31st March, there is nothing that will be tracked automatically here.\nUser can create a past streak upto 6 months in the past. For any use cases where higher limit is needed, reach out to product team.\nWhen APIs are being used to create past streak, it may not throw the 6 months validation but be careful when using the APIs directly for compatibility issues.\nTill code\n: Select the till code. This till code is used to attribute all the points that are going out from the streaks module. If you are a brand where there is no concept of till-code present, please create a dummy till-code from the org settings. The same till can be used in milestones as well.\nCustomer enrollment\nIn the\nCustomer enrolment\nsection, define the audience to whom you want to enroll in the Streaks program.\nAll customers:\nAll customers in the organization who have registered for loyalty will become part of the streak.\nAudience list:\nThis helps enroll the users into the streaks based on filters, existing user groups, or via CSV upload. This is similar to the audience capability in\nEngage+\n.\nNote:\nThis step is the same as the \"customer enrollment\" step in Milestones. For detailed information on this step, please visit the following page:\nhere\n.\nActivity\nThis is the core section of the streak where the brand has to configure the below components of the streak:\nActivity on which the streak will run, and the associated KPI.\nTarget value for each cycle\nFrequency of the streak\nScope filter & rule filters\nLevels of the streak also known as streak definitions\nDefining the type of activity on which Streaks need to be created.\nCustomer Activities\nCustomer activity refers to the various interactions a customer has with a brand. The table below lists the customer activities that can be tracked for a milestone.\nActivity\nDescription\nExample\nTransaction\nTrack customer purchases, in-store, online, or at a point-of-sale (POS) system.\nA customer purchases a pair of sneakers online or at a store.\nBehavioural event\nTrack customer activities like signing up, changing their profile picture, or adding items to their wish list.\nA customer adds items to their wish list on the app or website.\nEarn reward currency\nTrack the reward currencies (\npoints\nor\nalternate currencies\n) that a customer has earned during a certain period. The configuration for points and alternate currencies  are the same.\nYou can select only one reward currency per target. To track both points and alternate currencies within the same target / milestone, create a\nunified milestone\nwith two or more targets and select points or alternate currencies as the reward currencies for each target.\nA customer earns 500 reward points for purchasing a ₹5000 jacket during a promotional event.\nReferrals\nTrack the number of times a customer has successfully referred another person.\nA customer refers a friend using a unique link, and the friend makes the first purchase, earning the customer rewards.\nPoints redemption\nTrack how often customers use their points to redeem rewards, provided redemption is available.\nA customer uses 500 points to redeem a ₹500 discount while purchasing groceries\nCoupon redemption\nTrack the number of times a customer uses coupons to get discounts or benefits.\nA customer applies a 20% discount coupon during checkout in an online store.\nReturning a transaction\nTrack the number of transactions a customer returns, whether a full return or part of the purchase.\nA customer returns a t-shirt purchased online as it did not fit properly.\nUpdating a transaction\nTrack how many times a customer changes details about their previous purchases.\nA customer orders 1kg bananas and 1kg mangoes but later adjusts the order, reducing the mangoes to 500gms after receiving a partial refund.\nUpdating customer profile\nTrack how often a customer updates their personal information on their profile.\nA customer updates their phone number on the app.\nPromised points conversion\nTrack how many times\npromised points\n(temporary or pending rewards) are turned into regular points for the customer.\nTransfer points\nTrack how many times points are\ntransferred\nbetween customers or\nuser groups\n.\nA customer transfers their loyalty points to another customer.\nMilestone achieved\nTrack how many times a customer completes a target, such as spending a specific amount or completing a behavioral event such as drinking eight litres of water.\nNotes:\nThe following conditions are required to select a milestone/target to track:\n- The milestone/target timeline must be a fixed calendar window.\n- The frequency of the milestone must be lower than the milestone being created. For example, if the milestone being tracked has a frequency of daily, then the milestone being created must have a higher frequency like weekly or monthly.\n- The duration of the milestone must fit within the milestone being created.\n- The milestone must be active.\n- The tracking type must be default or unified. This is also supported for streaks, enabling “third-level tracking” use cases. For example: Brush twice a day, six times a week, for ten weeks in a quarter. Walk 5,000 steps a day, five times a week, for three weeks in a month Refer to the documentation for more information on\nthird-level tracking.\nA customer achieves a milestone by walking 10,000 steps daily for five consecutive days, as part of a fitness challenge.\nPoints redemption reversal\nTrack how many times redeemed points are reversed to the customer due to cancellations or errors.\nA customer cancels a flight ticket they booked using points, and the points are returned to their account.\nTransactional activities:\nHelps in tracking transactional properties\nGross sales (both bill level & line item level)\nThe total gross sales made by the user in the cycle. The gross amount is the amount on the bill before the user avails any kind of discount.\nNet sales (both bill level & line item level)\nThe total net sales made by the user in the cycle. The net amount is the final amount that the user has paid. This means the discounts will be excluded from the tracking.\nQuantity (line item level)\nThe number of quantities purchased by the user in the cycle. When used with a specific line item rule, the brand can track the number of specific line items bought by the user in the cycle.\nTransactions count (bill level)\nThe total number of transactions made by the user in the cycle.\nDays of activity (bill level)\nThe total number of unique days on which the user has made at least 1 transaction.\nTransactional extended fields\nThe following KPIs are supported:\nCOUNT: The number of times a transactional extended field came with a specific value. This specific value needs to be configured in the rule box.\nE.g.: The number of transactions that came with extended field value as \"Gold\".\nSUM: The sum of the selected transactional extended field in the cycle.\nLineitem extended fields\nThe following KPIs are supported:\nCOUNT: The number of times a line-item extended field came with a specific value. This specific value needs to be configured in the rule box.\nE.g.: The number of line items that came with the extended field value as \"edible food\".\nSUM: The sum of the selected line-item extended field in the cycle.\nReward currencies (aka points):\nRegular points: Number of regular points earned by the user in the cycle\nPromotional points: Number of promotional points earned by the user in the cycle\nBoth: Number of total regular & promotional points earned by the user in the cycle\nThe following image shows the screen when \"transaction\" is selected:\nBehavioral activities:\nHelps in tracking behavioral events\nAll the Behavioural events configured for the org will be available here.\nThe following KPIs are supported in behavioral events tracking:\nCOUNT: The number of times the event has been triggered in a cycle.\nVISIT: The number of unique days on which the event has been triggered in a cycle.\nSUM: Summing the attribute value of the behavioral event in a cycle.\nE.g.: Assume there is a behavioral event called \"walking\" with an attribute called \"steps walked\". Now, this attribute value can be summed in a period & based on that rewards can be assigned.\nThe following image shows the screen when the \"behavioral event\" is selected:\nAll other customer level activities:\nHelps in tracking how many times the various customer level activities/events (aka different customer level events present in the workflow in the loyalty) are triggered for a user in the defined period as per the configuration. The following are the supported customer activities:\nPoints redemptions\nCoupon redemptions\nReturn transaction\nPoints transfer\nTransaction updates\nCustomer profile updates\nPromised points conversions\nPoints redemption-reversal\nReferrals\nMilestones achieved: This type of tracking is available only during the creation of a fixed-calendar window (aka where a specific start date is selected) type of milestones and helps in tracking how many times a user has achieved a specific target group.\nOnce this tracking is selected, a new drop-down asking to select the target group will appear.\nA target group will be shown in this drop-down only when it satisfies the following conditions:\nFixed-calendar window (aka where a specific start date is selected) type\nFrequency is inferior to the current milestone's frequency\nDuration should fit within the current milestone's duration\nShould be active\nThe tracking type should be either \"default\" or \"unified\".\nThis type of tracking helps in unlocking \"3rd level tracking use cases\" which are extremely difficult to implement. Some of the sample use cases that will be possible are:\nBrush 2 times a day, 6 times a week, 10 weeks in a quarter\nWalk 5000 steps a day, 5 times a week, 3 weeks in a month.\nRefer to this\nconfluence page\nto understand more about these \"3rd level tracking\" use cases, and how they work with the help of simulations.\nThe following KPIs are supported for all the above events:\nCOUNT: The number of times the specific event selected is triggered in a cycle\nVISIT: The number of unique days on which the specific event has been triggered in a cycle.\nNote\n: Tracking for all the other events also will be available soon\nThe following example shows the screen when one of the EMF events (points redemption is selected):\nAn eagle-eye view of the above looks like this:\nnote\n: In the above table, EMF-level events are nothing but all other customer-level events/activities described in the previous paragraphs.\nFrequency of each cycle\nAfter selecting the tracking configurations based on the use case, the frequency for each cycle in which the user must achieve the defined value by the streak needs to be selected.\nYou can select a frequency from the available options or define a duration (custom duration).\nCustom duration\nThis option can be used when the user has to perform the specified activity within a custom duration, which is not available in the above options. For example, every 5 days, every 13 days, every 2 months, etc. Refer to the below images to learn more about custom duration.\nUpload duration\nYou can click\nUpload duration\nand add the duration details in the sample template format provided.\nSelecting predefined duration\nThe below options are available:\nDaily\nWeekly\nMonthly\nYearly\nDepending on the chosen frequency, this option will present two choices for Weekly/Monthly/Yearly types. In the \"Any day\" scenario, users can perform their activity on any day of the cycle, while in the \"Specific days\" scenario, users are required to perform the activity on designated days.\nWeekly:\nAny day of the week\nSpecific days of the week**\nMonthly:\nAny day of the month\nSpecific days of the month**\nYearly\nAny day of the year\nSpecific days of the month**\nTarget value needed to be achieved in selected each frequency:\nWhen the \"Any day of the week/month/year\" is selected for the duration, then the target value that needs to be achieved has to be entered manually.\nWhen the \"Specific day of the week/month/year\" is selected for the duration, then the target value for the frequency will be calculated automatically.\nFor example, say frequency is selected \"weekly\" and \"specific days of the week\" are selected as Monday, Wednesday & Friday, then the target value will be interpreted as 3 automatically.\nFilters: scope-based & rule-based\nThe filters available are scope-based & rule-based filters.\nScope based filtering:\nStores: Limit the streak to specific retail locations.\nZones: Apply the streak to defined geographical areas.\nConcepts: Limits the streak to specific OUs\nTo define the streaks for complete stores, zones, and concepts, select\nAll store, zone, and concept\n.\nTo define the Milestones for a specific store, zone, and concept, select\nSpecific store, zone, and concept\nand select the stores/zones/concept.\nRule-based filtering\n:\nFor further refinement, you can define the rules in the rule box. For example, rules can be written to target specific line items, categories, minimum transaction amounts, etc.\nCategories: Target specific product categories within the Milestone.\nLine items: Apply the Milestone to specific products or SKUs.\nTransaction amount: Set minimum or maximum purchase amounts for Milestone progress.\nStreak levels also known as definitions\nIn the text box, you can enter the duration for which the streak should be maintained.\nYou can use the toggle switch to disable or enable a non-continuous streak.\nConsider a scenario for your coffee brand's loyalty program:\nRequirement: Customers must enjoy a cup of your brand's coffee every day.\nStreak level/definition: Maintain a streak of 5 months within the streak duration.\nStreak Duration: one year\nHow it works:\nAchievement: Customers achieve the streak by drinking the brand's coffee every single day for a continuous period of 5 months.\nBreak Reset: If a customer misses a day, the streak counter resets to zero, and they must start building the streak again from scratch.\nNotes:\nA user can add 10 different streak definitions in a single streak\nStreak levels need to be entered in ascending order.\nA user can achieve the streak level \"X+1\", only when the user has already achieved the \"X\" level.\nThe maximum streak value should always be \"<=\" number of cycles. For example, say the duration is given as 2 months & frequency is given as weekly, then the maximum number of possible cycles is 8.\nNon-continuous streaks\nNon-continuous streaks, allow users to maintain a streak without performing the associated activity continuously. In this type of streak, breaks or gaps between performing the activity are permitted, as long as the user completes the activity a specified number of times within a defined timeframe. This feature is particularly useful when users may not be able to consistently engage in an activity every day or on a regular schedule but still want to achieve a goal over a period of time.\nIn the example above, if you set it as a non-continuous streak, customers achieve the streak if they drink the brand's coffee for any of the 5 months in the streak duration.\nClick\nShow preview\nto view a preview of the streak definition.\nOnce all these configurations are successfully configured, click\nPreview & Save\nto save the streaks.\n📘\nAs of today, event notifications are not available for streaks. Please be mindful about this, we will bring this soon.\nSub-targets in streaks\nSub-targets are a powerful capability that brands can use to interact with their customers mid-day the customer's journey towards the full target.\nThe behavior of sub-targets in streaks is the same as the behavior of sub-targets in milestones.\nThey work across each cycle of the entire streak duration\nThe sub-target rules that need to be written in promotions are the same as the milestones\nSub-targets can be created based on absolute/percentage value based on the KPI\nRefer to the following section for more details:\nhere\nUpdated\n2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nAccessing streaks\nStreaks home page\nCreating streak\nBasic details\nCustomer enrollment\nActivity\nStreak levels also known as definitions\nSub-targets in streaks"

This means that, for all the users of the streak, the streak will start & end on the same date.\nCan I create streaks where I don't want my user to perform the activity continuously? I'm okay with breaks also as long as the user does the activity 'n' times.\nThis is being called \"non-continuous\" streaks. Yes, this is possible. During the creation flow of the streak, in the \"activity\" step, look for the \"non-continuous\" toggle.\nCan I give benefits multiple times for the same level to a user?\nA user can get the benefits only once for a level in a streak.\nWhat is the difference between a continuous streak & non-continuous streak?\nIn the case of the continuous streak, the streak value will reset whenever there is a break in achieving the activity by the user. Think of this as a Snapchat streak.\nIn the case of the non-continuous streak, the streak value won't get reset even if there is a break from the user in achieving the activity. This is more flexible.\nHow does the SUM KPI in behavioural events work as I was asked to select an attribute mandatorily?\nExample: There is a behavioural event created by the brand that always tracks whenever a user walks. The number of steps walked by the user is stored in the attribute of the event to show that to the user on their mobile app.\nNow, the brand wants to reward its users with 1000 points whenever a user walks 50k steps in a week. In this case, tracking the number of times the user has walked won't help, rather we have to sum the attribute value whenever the event is being triggered.\nBy using this functionality, the use cases like the above can also be achieved.\nAre there any filters available where I can filter my customers based on their streak value?\nAs of now, there are no filters available where customers can be filtered on their streak value. Contact the support team whenever you encounter such use cases.\nI cannot see the name of the streak definition/levels in the UI, however, it seems that I have to write rules based on the exact level name. How does this work?\nAs of now, you cannot provide a custom name for each level of the streak. This feature will be available in the future.\nUntil then, the name of a streak level will be \"streak name_X\". Say, you have 2 levels in your streak & the name of the streak is ABC.\nName of the level 1 is \"ABC_1\"\nName of the level 2 is \"ABC_2\".\nIs there any support for event notifications in Streaks?\nAs of today, there is no support for event notifications in streaks. However, this feature will be available in the future.\nUpdated\n12 months ago"

This report provides a high level view of the points issual and redemption trend, value from extra sales and the overall points liability.\n📘\nUse this report for points liability reporting\nThis report provides the standard Points liability ledger chart and it is the recommended method to checking your overall liability from points in the system\nPoints liability ledger\nThe goal of this chart is to give a complete view of the points liability in the loyalty program.\nBy default, the points liability ledger chart shows the opening and closing balances, points credited, points debited and liability for the report's time period\nThe opening balance is calculated as on the EOD of the previous date before the date range selected in the report. For example, if you want to check the chart or report for 1st April to 30th April 2022, the opening balance would be calculated as Points Credit ITD - Points Debit ITD as on EOD 31st March 2022\nThe closing balance is calculated as on the EOD of the end date of the date range selected in the report. For example, if you want to check the chart or report for 1st April to 30th April 2022, the closing balance would be calculated as Opening Balance + Points Credit - Points Debit as on EOD 30th April 2022\n🚧\nInclusions in points liability ledger\nThe report and the charts\nonly include redeemable/regular points\n. Promised points are not included in these charts\nThe liability ledger chart by default includes all stores (including admin) and all customers (including fraud) - these are excluded by default in most charts. We have chosen to include them by default since they give a complete picture of the liability\nYou can exclude or account for them by creating custom charts using these KPIs\nPoints credited is the sum of all issued and adjusted points (Points adjustments are made typically to handle returns and include redemptions reverted, redemptions reversed, transfers reverted and expiries reverted)\nPoints debited is the sum of all redeemed, expired and returned pointsOD + Opening Balance for the date range.\nLiability itself is used as ITD KPI in this chart, even if the chart and report are set for different timeframes. Liability represents the outstanding points balance as on a given date\nThe chart uses month as the dimension and you can expand each month to see the breakup of the different types of debits and adjustments at a date level\nPoints event type for adjustment entries may also display as POINTS_DEDUCTED because of how they are stored in the database, they however represent credit entries and you will see values against them in the points credited column\nUsing the Liability KPI to create custom charts\nIf you rather want to use this chart by considering exclusions, for example, if you want to view the data after excluding fraud customers, you can create a customer chart by using the Liability KPI and then changing the advanced settings as required\nYou can use stores, time frames, etc. as dimensions, but when you create custom charts for a particular time period, keep in mind that you should be using the ITD charts only, otherwise the liability data obtained would not be correct. If charts are not ITD, liability data obtained would be only for the specified date range, and that would not be the correct method to look at liability\nThe report contains the following charts\nChart\nKPI/Chart\nDescription\nPoints issued and points redeemed trend\nChart\nPoints Issued (The total number of points issued to loyalty customers) and Points Redeemed (The total number of points redeemed by the Loyalty customers) plotted with Date as dimension\nSales vs extra sales across geography\nChart\nTotal sales and the Extra Sales (Sales from transactions against which some points have been redeemed) plotted with Store as dimension\nPoints liability ledger\nChart\nThis is a special ledger chart which shows the opening balance (points balance as on the beginning of the report start date) and closing balance (points balance as on the end of the report end date)\nPoints can be issued for referral campaigns.

It identifies long standing trends and sudden anomalies in your program KPIs.\nNudges let you ensure all basic program components are set up well and running smoothly.\nThe following are some use cases that you can achieve through Nudges\nBoost Loyalty through points redemption\nLet’s say, our Nudge framework discovered that your Loyalty program's Points Expiry Reminder isn't activated on. The industrial figures suggest 63% of customers prefer to shop at brands in which they have active Loyalty points. The system has analyzed that in the next six months, 76 million points are expiring across the brand for 674K customers.\nSuggestion: You have a chance to retain 63% of 674K customers who are likely to churn due to points expiring. Set it up now!\nManage Covid impact through Loyalty\nThe Nudge framework detected a decrease in Points redemption and increase in points expiring due to the Covid-19 lockdowns. Analysis says that in the last one year, points were expired for 75% of your customers.\nSuggestion: Get your top customers back to the stores. Increase footfall by up to 75% by extending points expiry for 1 month. Configure it now\nView Mode vs Edit Mode\nView Mode is visible on the dashboard by default. You can see all configured strategies here.\nBy clicking on the\nEdit Program\nbutton, you can go over to the diting section where you can change the strategies, trackers and workflows for your loyalty program.\nUpdated\nabout 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nOverall Loyalty Performance\nKPI Dashboard\nLoyalty Nudges\nView Mode vs Edit Mode"

As they name suggested, they are meant for customisation as per the brand's needs.\nTo understand with an example, a field which is very much required for a diamond brand (like Joyalukkas) might not be necessary for an electronics brand (like Croma).\nSo for Joyalukkas, a custom field (let's say, diameter of the diamond) need to be created for their activities & actions.  These fields are relatively very easy to create, and have 3 primary actions:\nCreation of custom field\nEditing the custom field\nDeleting the custom field\nFollowing media helps in understanding how to do that:\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nCreation/deletion/editing of custom fields."

Customers receive a tier upgrade when they meet specific eligibility criteria set within the tier configurations or sometimes via workflows (using upgrade-to-tier action).\n📘\nNote\nTier upgrades for a loyalty program can be configured in the advanced settings of the program. Refer to the documentation on\nadvanced settings\nfor more information.\nPrerequisites\nBefore configuring the eligibility criteria for a tier upgrade, ensure the following are met:\nConfigure a loyalty program\nCreate the tiers\nCreate the trackers\nEligibility criteria\nA customer can receive a tier upgrade by meeting the eligibility criteria set in the program. The following are the criteria available currently for a tier upgrade:\n1. Current points\nCurrent points are the active points that a customer has at present. The customer must meet a certain threshold of points set by the loyalty program to qualify for the upgrade.\nExample\nConsider the following case:\nUpgrade eligibility from a base tier to a higher tier:\n1000 points\nThe points the customer holds at present:\n900 points\nIn this case, the customer must earn\n100 more active points\nto meet the criteria for upgrading the tier. When the customer meets the eligibility criteria of\n1000 points\n, they are upgraded to the higher tier.\n2. Lifetime points\nLifetime points are the total points a customer has earned throughout their journey in the program. These include active, expired, and redeemed points. The customer must meet a certain threshold of lifetime points set by the loyalty program to qualify for the upgrade.\nExample\nConsider the following case:\nUpgrade eligibility from a base tier to a higher tier:\n5000 lifetime points\nTotal lifetime points customer earned:\n3500 points\nIn this case, the customer must earn\n1500 more points\nto meet the eligibility criteria. When the customer reaches\n5000 lifetime points\n, they are upgraded to the higher tier.\n3. Lifetime purchases\nLifetime purchases are the total amount a customer has spent throughout their journey in the program. The customer must meet a certain threshold of lifetime purchases set by the loyalty program to qualify for the upgrade.\nExample\nConsider the following case:\nUpgrade eligibility from a base tier to a higher tier:\n$5000 lifetime purchases\nTotal lifetime purchases of the customer:\n$4000\nIn this case, the customer has to make a purchase of at least\n$1000\nto meet the eligibility criteria. When the customer reaches $5,000 in spending, they are upgraded to the higher tier.\n4. Trackers\nA tracker is a tool used to track custom values over a specific period and set it as an eligibility criterion for upgrading the tier. Custom values can include bill amount, gross bill amount, points, line item price, and number of customer visits to the store.\nUp to three trackers can be defined for a tier upgrade.\nRefer to the documentation on\ntrackers\nfor more information.\n📘\nNote:\nWhen a tier program is updated to include a tracker as an eligibility criterion, the tracker will only track the customer’s previous custom values for tier upgrades. For tier downgrades and renewals, the tracker will start monitoring custom values from the date it was configured in the tier program.\nExample\nConsider the following case:\nEligibility criteria: number of customer visits to the store\n>4\nTracking period:\n12 months\nThe number of times the customer has visited the store in the last 10 months:\n4\nIn this case, the customer must visit the store again in the next two months to meet the eligibility criteria. When the customer visits the store and makes a purchase, the customer is upgraded to a higher tier.\nIf the customer returns their transaction made on the fifth visit, the value will be reduced to four visits. Consequently, the tier upgrade will be reversed, and the customer will be downgraded to the previous tier.\nCreating upgrade criteria\nYou can create dynamic upgrade criteria for tier upgrades by combining multiple criteria. You can define up to three eligibility criteria for a tier upgrade.\nThree types of logical operations can be placed between these criteria depending on the use case:\n1. Any (N-1) condition\nThe\nAny (N-1)\noperation can define the number of conditions required to qualify for a tier upgrade. When this operation is applied, the customer must meet the specified number of criteria to qualify for a tier upgrade.\nFor example, assume there are 4 conditions/criteria defined in the eligibility criteria of the tier. Now, when the \"ANY\" is selected, the brand will have the following options:\nANY 1\nThis is just like a simple 'OR' condition. Among the 4 conditions, the user has to satisfy any 1 condition.\nANY 2\nAmong the 4 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 2 conditions.\nANY 3\nAmong the 4 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 3 conditions.\nNote:\nAs per the above example, there is no \"ANY 4\". This is because, if the user has to follow all the 4 conditions that are present, then it is like \"ALL 4\". That is why, the ANY will have values till (N-1).\nTo understand more about this, refer to the following example:\nAny condition example section\n.\n2. All condition\nIf all the criteria must be satisfied to qualify for a tier upgrade, the\nAll\ncondition can be used. When an\nAll\ncondition is applied, the customer must meet all of specified criteria to qualify for a tier upgrade.\nRefer to the\nAll condition example section\nfor more information.\n📘\nNote\nFor an\nAny\ncondition, the upgrade type must be the same for all criteria. Selecting multiple upgrade types is not supported.\nThis is primarily because, if different upgrade types are used in different conditions, in the event of success there is no way for the system to know \"which condition's upgrade\" criteria it should follow.\nRefer to the\ntypes of tier upgrades\nfor more information.\n3. Custom condition\nCustom conditions allow you to create a combination of\nAny\nand\nAll\nconditions and define a custom expression for the eligibility criteria for a tier upgrade.\nRefer to the\ncustom condition example section\nfor more information.\nCustomer tracker with the condition\n(A AND B) OR C\n❗️\nImportant\nAll expressions are evaluated from left to right.\nE.g.: The expression\nA OR B AND C\nis read as\n(A OR B) AND C\nas it is evaluated from left to right.\nIt is recommended to use parentheses\n()\nand define the operators in full (\nAND\nor\nOR\n) or as (\n&&\nor\n||\n) when defining expressions to avoid ambiguity and ensure successful validation.\nUsing a single\n&\nor\n|\nis invalid and unsupported.\nExamples of tier upgrades\n1. Any (N-1) condition\nA brand has a travel rewards program that rewards customers and rewards a Platinum status for its most loyal customers. Platinum customers receive extra perks, such as larger discounts and access to premium partner hotels.\nThe criteria for reaching Platinum status are as follows:\nEarn\n1500 lifetime points\nby using the brand's services\nTake\n5 flights\nin the last\n12 months\nStay in\n3 partner hotels\nin the last\n12 months\nThe brand has set an\nAny 1\ncondition for the tier upgrade. This means that if a customer meets any one of the above criteria, they will be upgraded to the Platinum tier.\nTo create an\nAny\ncondition tier upgrade criteria, follow these steps:\nNavigate to\nHome > Loyalty+\nfrom the InTouch portal.\nCreate or edit\nan existing loyalty program and\ncreate the tiers\nif required.\nCreate and configure\nall the required criteria trackers.\nCreating a flight tracker\nCreating a hotel stay tracker\nNavigate to the\nAdvanced settings\nfor the program to define conditions for a tier upgrade.\nSelect\n+Tracker\nto add a new tracker and select the\nTracker\n,\nTracking period\nand the\nUpgrade type\n.\nSelect\nAny\nas the condition once all the trackers have been defined.\nSelect the minimum number of conditions to be satisfied for a tier upgrade.\nClick on\nDone\nto save the changes.\n2. All condition\nA gym has a fitness reward program that rewards regular customers. There are three tiers in the program: Pro, Elite and Ultimate. The Ultimate tier has the most perks: six free fitness classes per month and access to personal trainers.\nThe criteria for reaching the Ultimate tier are as follows:\nAccumulate\n2000 current points\nWorkout at least\n15 times\nin the last\n3 months\nPurchase gym accessories worth\n$500\nin the last\n3 months\nThe brand has set an\nAll\ncondition for the tier upgrade. This means that if a customer has met ALL of the above three criteria, they will be upgraded to the Ultimate tier.\nTo create an\nAll\nconditions tier upgrade criteria, follow these steps:\nNavigate to\nHome > Loyalty+\nfrom the InTouch portal.\nCreate or edit\nan existing loyalty program and\ncreate the tiers\nif required.\nCreate and configure\nall the required criteria trackers.\nCreating a workout tracker\nCreating a purchase tracker\nNavigate to the\nAdvanced settings\nfor the program to define conditions for a tier upgrade.\nSelect\n+Tracker\nto add a new tracker and select the\nTracker\n,\nTracking period\nand the\nUpgrade type\n.\nSelect\nAll\nas the condition once all the trackers have been defined.\nClick on\nDone\nto save the changes.\n3. Custom condition\nAn e-commerce site has a loyalty reward program that rewards regular users of the platform. The site offers a Plus status for its most loyal customers. Plus users receive extra perks, such as larger discounts and early access to sales.\nThe criteria for reaching Plus status are as follows:\nAccumulate\n3000 current points\n(A)\nMake at least\n5 purchases\nin the last\n6 months\n(B)\nSpend over\n$1000\nin a single transaction (C)\nThe brand has set a custom condition with the expression\n(A AND B) OR C\nfor the tier upgrade. The customer must meet both conditions A and B or meet condition C to be eligible. This means that if a customer has accumulated 3000 points AND made five purchases in the last six months, OR if the customer has spent over $1000 in a single transaction, they will be upgraded to the Plus tier.\nTo create a custom tier upgrade criteria, follow these steps:\nNavigate to\nHome > Loyalty+\nfrom the InTouch portal.\nCreate or edit\nan existing loyalty program and\ncreate the tiers\nif required.\nCreate and configure\nall the required criteria trackers.\nCreating a customer purchase tracker\nCreating a tracker for purchases over $1000\nNavigate to the\nAdvanced settings\nfor the program to define conditions for a tier upgrade.\nSelect\n+Tracker\nto add a new tracker and select the\nTracker\n,\nTracking period\nand the\nUpgrade type\n.\nSelect\nCustom\nas the condition once all the trackers have been defined.\nDefine the expression for the custom tier upgrade under the\nExpressions\nbox.\n❗️\nImportant\nAll expressions are evaluated from left to right.\nFor example, the expression\nA OR B AND C\nis read as\n(A OR B) AND C\nas it is evaluated from left to right.\nIt is recommended to use parentheses\n()\nand define the operators in full (\nAND\nor\nOR\n) or as (\n&&\nor\n||\n) when defining expressions to avoid ambiguity and ensure successful validation.\nUsing a single\n&\nor\n|\nis invalid and unsupported.\nSelect ✔ to validate the expression.\nClick on\nDone\nto save the changes.\nTypes of tier upgrades\nThe classification of tier upgrades depends on how points are awarded when a transaction occurs at the eligibility threshold between two tiers.\nConsider the following case:\nTier\nReward percentage\nper purchase amount\nLifetime purchase requirement\nSilver\n10%\n-\nGold\n20%\n>= $10000\nDiamond\n30%\n>= $15000\nIn this case, there are three tiers in a loyalty program: Silver, Gold, and Diamond. The Silver tier awards 10% points for every transaction amount spent, Gold awards 20%, and Diamond awards 30%.\nA customer is currently in the Gold tier with a lifetime purchase value of $14,000 and the criteria for upgrading to the Diamond tier is a lifetime purchase requirement of $15,000.\nThe customer now makes a transaction of $2000.\nIn this situation, you can award points to the customer in three ways:\nIssue points and then upgrade to the next tier (Lazy):\nAward points based on the current tier before upgrading. In this case, the customer receives the benefits of the Gold tier, which amounts to 20% of $2000, that is 400 points, and is then upgraded to the Diamond tier.\nUpgrade to the next tier and then issue points (Eager):\nUpgrade the tier first, then award points based on the new tier. In this case, the customer is upgraded to the Diamond tier and is then rewarded with points equal to 30% of $2000 that is 600 points.\nIssue points, upgrade tier, and then issue remaining points (Dynamic):\nAward points for the portion of the transaction that qualifies for the current tier, then upgrade the tier and award points for the remaining transaction amount. In this case, the customer earns 200 points for the initial $1000 transaction and then advances to the Diamond tier. Afterward, within the Diamond tier, the customer earns the remaining 300 points for the additional $1000 transaction amount.\n🚧\nImpact on tier upgrades on returning a transaction\nIf a customer returns a transaction that resulted in a tier upgrade, the upgrade will be reversed, and the customer will be downgraded to the previous eligible tier.\nUpdated\n6 months ago\nTable of Contents\nPrerequisites\nEligibility criteria\n1.

A renewal check is executed based on the expiration of the tier validity period, and if the conditions are satisfied, the customer qualifies for a tier renewal.\nRefer to\nconfiguring tier validity\nfor more information.\nIf a customer does not qualify for a tier renewal they will be downgraded to a lower tier.\nRefer to\nconfiguring tier downgrade\nfor more information.\nPrerequisites\nBefore configuring the eligibility criteria for a tier renewal, ensure the following are met:\nConfigure a loyalty program\nCreate the tiers\nCreate the trackers\nEligibility criteria\nA customer can receive a tier renewal by meeting any of the eligibility criteria set in the program. The following are the criteria available for a tier renewal:\n1. Purchase\nPurchases are the total amount a customer has spent throughout the tier validity period. The customer must meet a certain threshold of purchases set by the loyalty program to qualify for a tier renewal.\nExample\nConsider the following case:\nRenewal eligibility for the tier:\n$5000\nTotal purchases of the customer:\n$4000\nIn this case, the customer has to make a purchase of at least\n$1000\nto  qualify for a renewal. If the customer does not reach\n$5,000\nin spending before the validity period ends, they will not qualify for a tier renewal, and their tier will be downgraded.\n2. Number of visits\nNumber of visits is the total number of times a customer has visited the store throughout the tier validity period. The customer must meet a certain number of visits set by the loyalty program to qualify for a tier renewal.\nExample\nConsider the following case:\nRenewal eligibility for the tier:\n10 store visits\nTotal visits of the customer:\n8 store visits\nIn this case, the customer has to visit the store at least\ntwo\nmore times to qualify for a renewal. If the customer does not reach\nten store visits\nbefore the validity period ends, they will not qualify for a tier renewal, and their tier will be downgraded.\n3. Points earned\nPoints are the total points a customer has earned throughout the tier validity period. These include active, expired, and redeemed points. The customer must meet a certain threshold of points set by the loyalty program to qualify for the renewal.\nExample\nConsider the following case:\nRenewal eligibility for the tier:\n5000 points\nTotal points customer earned:\n3500 points\nIn this case, the customer must earn\n1500 more points\nto qualify for a renewal. If the customer does not reach\n5000 points\nbefore the validity period ends, they will not qualify for a tier renewal, and their tier will be downgraded.\n4. Trackers\nA tracker is a tool used to track custom values over a specific period and set it as an eligibility criterion for renewing the tier. Custom values can include bill amount, gross bill amount, points, line item price, and number of customer visits to the store.\nUp to 3 trackers can be defined for a tier renewal.\nRefer to the documentation on\ntrackers\nfor more information.\nExample\nConsider the following case:\nRenewal eligibility for the tier:\n10 flights\nTotal flights taken by customer:\n8 flights\nIn this case. the customer must take\ntwo more flights\nto qualify for a renewal. If the customer does not reach\nten flights\nbefore the validity period ends, they will not qualify for a tier renewal, and their tier will be downgraded.\nCreating dynamic renewal criteria\nYou can create dynamic criteria for tier renewal by combining multiple criteria. You can define up to three separate eligibility criteria for a tier renewal.\nThere are three types of conditions you can set to define the renewal criteria:\n1. Any (N-1) condition\nThe\nAny (N-1)\noperation can define the number of conditions required to qualify for a tier renewal. When this operation is applied, the customer must meet the specified number of criteria to qualify for a tier renewal.\nFor example, assume there are 5 conditions/criteria defined in the renewal criteria of the tier. Now, when the \"ANY\" is selected, the brand will have the following options:\nANY 1\nThis is just like a simple 'OR' condition. Among the 5 conditions, the user has to satisfy any 1 condition.\nANY 2\nAmong the 5 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 2 conditions.\nANY 3\nAmong the 5 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 3 conditions.\nANY 4\nAmong the 5 conditions present, the user has to satisfy any 4 conditions.\nNote\n: As per the above example, there is no \"ANY 5\". This is because, if the user has to follow all the 5 conditions that are present, then it is like \"ALL 5\". That is why, the ANY will have values till (N-1).\nRefer to the\nAny condition example section\nfor more information.\n2. All condition\nIf all the criteria must be satisfied to qualify for a tier renewal, the\nAll\ncondition can be used. When an\nAll\ncondition is applied, the customer must meet all of specified criteria to qualify for a tier renewal.\nRefer to the\nAll condition example section\nfor more information.\n3. Custom condition\nCustom conditions allow you to create a combination of\nAny\nand\nAll\nconditions and define a custom expression for the eligibility criteria for a tier renewal.\nRefer to the\ncustom condition example section\nfor more information.\nTracker with condition\n(A AND B) OR C\n❗️\nImportant\nAll expressions are evaluated from left to right.\nE.g.: the expression\nA OR B AND C\nis read as\n(A OR B) AND C\nas it is evaluated from left to right.\nIt is recommended to use parentheses\n()\nand define the operators in full (\nAND\nor\nOR\n) or as (\n&&\nor\n||\n) when defining expressions to avoid ambiguity and ensure successful validation.\nUsing a single\n&\nor\n|\nis invalid and unsupported.\nExamples for tier renewal\n1. Any (N-1) condition\nA restaurant has a loyalty program that rewards frequent diners with the Gourmet tier, which includes perks like complimentary appetizers and priority seating.\nThe renewal criteria for the Gourmet tier are as follows:\nSpend a total of\n$1500\non dining\nVisit the restaurant at least\n10 times\nPurchase at least\n5\ndifferent menu items\nThe brand has set an\nAny 1\ncondition for the tier renewal.

This means that if a customer has met ALL of the above criteria when their Scholar Plus tier is about to expire, their tier will be renewed.\nTo create an\nAny\ncondition tier renewal criteria, follow these steps:\nNavigate to\nHome > Loyalty+\nfrom the InTouch portal.\nCreate or edit\nan existing loyalty program and\ncreate the tiers\nif required.\nCreate and configure\nall the required criteria trackers.\nCreating a course tracker\nNavigate to\nRenewal conditions\nsection under the settings for the tier to define conditions for a tier renewal.\nSelect\n+Condition\n, select the eligibility criteria and enter the value.\nSelect\nAll\nas the condition once all the criteria have been defined.\nClick on\nDone\nto save the changes.\n3.

During this time, customers have the opportunity to upgrade to a higher tier and then the validity period of the customer is adjusted to align with their upgraded tier.\nUse case\nConsider the below scenario:\nThe date the customer upgraded to a higher tier was April 15, 2024.\nThe fixed duration for the renewal check is 12 months.\nThe renewal check for the customer happens on April 15, 2025. Suppose the customer has met his eligibility criteria for upgrading to a higher tier and gets upgraded on October 25, 2024. Now the customer gets the renewal check extended to October 25, 2024, instead of April 15, 2025.\n📘\nNote\nIf the expiry date for a tier is changed, only new customers who will be upgraded or downgraded to that tier are affected by the change. Existing customers will keep their previous expiry date.\nTo update the tier expiry information of existing customers of a tier, use the\nslab data import function\n.\nUntil the next registration date of customer\nThe registration date refers to the date when a customer registers as a loyalty customer. In this scenario, the program annually validates the validity of the tier based on the registration date of the customer.\nUse cases\nScenario 1\nConsider the below scenario:\nThe registration date of a customer into a program is October 25, 2024\nThe date on which the customer made an upgrade to a higher tier: October 15, 2025\nIn that case, the renewal check of the tier happens on October 25, 2025. But, if you prefer to make the customer stay in that new tier for a minimum duration, you can set the minimum duration as 6 months.\nIn this case, the renewal check becomes nullified for 6 months on entering the new tier, then the renewal check will only happen to the customer on October 15, 2026.\nScenario 2\nConsider another scenario, where the customer registration date is on a leap year.\nThe customer registers into a program on February 29, 2024, which is a leap year.\nThe following renewal checks for the tier in the years ahead occur on the following dates:\nFebruary 28, 2025\nFebruary 28, 2026\nFebruary 28, 2027\nOn the next leap year 2028, the renewal check happens on February 29.\nUntil fixed date\nThe validity of the tier is validated on a configured fixed date every year.\nUse case\nConsider the below scenario:\nThe date the customer upgraded to a higher tier: April 15, 2024\nConfigured fixed date: April 20\nIn this case, the renewal check of the tier happens on April 20, 2025. But, you prefer to make the customer stay in the new tier for a minimum duration of 6 months.\nIn this case, the renewal check becomes nullified for 6 months on entering the new tier and the next renewal check happens on April 20, 2026.\nConfiguring validity period\nTo configure\nvalidity period\n, perform the following steps:\nIn\nEdit tier\n, enable\nValidity\n. Once this is enabled in any of the tiers, the validity options will get enabled for you in advanced settings.\nIn\nAdvanced settings\n, under \"\nValidity\n\", select\nValidity Period\n.\nAs you can see here, The Validity section provides three options.\nUntil tier upgrade or Fixed duration\nUntil the next registration date of customer\nUntil fixed date\nIf you select:\nUntil Tier upgrade or Fixed Duration\n, in the\nFixed duration\n, enter the months after which the tier expires.\nUntil next registration date of customer\n, check\nAdd minimum duration\nbox to set the minimum duration.\n📘\nMinimum Duration in case of Registration date\nBy setting a minimum duration, the tier stays valid for that  minimum duration during the first cycle, the validity check will begin from the customer’s registration date every year.\nUntil Fixed Date\n, in the\nFixed date\n, you can set the date for which the tier expires.\n📘\nMinimum Duration in case of Fixed date\nBy setting a minimum duration, the tier stays valid for that minimum duration during the first cycle, and the validity check will begin from the fixed date every year.\nCheck tier expiry on a daily basis\nEnabling this option allows you to validity check the renewal conditions and corresponding downgrades daily.\n📘\nNote:\nBy default, the validity check of the renewal conditions and corresponding downgrades happens only on the last day of each month.\nConfiguring renewal conditions\nTo configure\nrenewal conditions\n, perform the following steps:\nIn\nEdit tier\n, enable the\nRenewal conditions\n.\nIn\nRenew current tier if any of the following conditions are true from\n, perform the following steps:\nEnable\nPurchases\nand enter the purchase value.\nEnable\nNo of visits\nand enter the number of visits that the customer has to make within the validity period of the tier.\nEnable\nPoints earned\nand enter the number of points that the customer needs to earn within the validity period.\n📘\nYou can also add tracker as an renewal condition on selecting\n+Add tracker\n.\nSelect \"\nDone\n\".\n📘\nTier renewal happens if any of the when conditions enabled are satisfied.\nExtension of tier after renewal\nExtension of tier renewal specifies how long the tier is extended once the customer meets the renewal conditions.

The system will then perform the next renewal check on May 15, 2024, evaluating the renewal conditions from May 15, 2023, to May 15, 2024.\nBy tier’s validity period duration\nThe tier gets renewed for the predefined value set in the fixed duration of the tier validity.\nUse Case\nConsider the below scenario:\nThe date the customer upgraded to a higher tier was April 15, 2024.\nThe fixed duration configured for the renewal check is 12 months.\nThe renewal check for the customer happens on April 15, 2025, and the tier gets renewed for 12 months and the next renewal check happens only on April 15, 2026.\nBy the duration of the tier's validity period from a fixed date\nThe tier gets renewed till the configured fixed date, and the renewal check happens on the fixed date.\nUse case\nConsider the below scenario:\nConfigured fixed date of the tier: January 1, 2025\nIn this case, the renewal check happens for all the customers in the organization on January 1, 2025.\n📘\nNote:\nOnce the set fixed date has passed, you must access the tier configuration to establish the fixed date for the following year.\nTier renewal until the next registration date of the customer\nAfter the renewal check, the tier stays valid for 12 months from the registration date to the same date the next year.\nUse case\nConsider the below scenario:\nThe registration date of a customer into a program is October 25, 2024.\nThe date the customer upgraded to a higher tier was October 15, 2025.\nConfigured minimum duration: 6 months.\nIn this case, the program is configured with a minimum duration of 6 months, so the renewal check on October 15, 2025, will be nullified. The system will conduct the renewal check of the tier on October 25, 2026, and upon meeting the renewal conditions, the tier of the customer is renewed, and the next renewal check happens only on October 25, 2027.\nTier renewal until fixed date\nAfter the renewal check on the fixed date, the tier stays valid from the fixed date to the fixed date next year.\nUse case\nConsider the below scenario:\nThe configured fixed date: January 1\nIn this case, the system conducts the renewal check of the tier for all the customers within that organization on January 1, 2025.

We can use fetch APIs, which can be used to get tier information of a customer. Also, light APIs are also used to get the most important/relevant part of the customer’s tier dynamics quickly. If the customer is in the base tier, no expiry date is required and if in the top tier, the next tier number is set to -1.\nThe system can calculate the gap to upgrade and the gap to renew parameters for customers, which are aimed to get the information on the gap or value of the tier upgrade parameter used, which is yet to be allocated to upgrade the customer’s current tier. But this is an add-on feature, so please raise a request to get this activated and only then can it be used for the org.\nYou can read about importing data for tiers/slabs\nhere\n.\nUpdated\n11 months ago"

A new tier is always an upgrade to the last tier. If it is highly\nrequired to add a tier in between two tiers, contact your Capillary PoC. The Capillary Admin needs to perform\nthe following steps.\nEdit all the tiers from where you need to modify\nChange rule expressions and conditions\nDo a data clean up\nReconfigure the loyalty program\nCan I change the points allocation type of an existing tier?\nWhen you create a tier, it shows the default points allocation type - prorated (% of the transaction amount). To\nchange the points allocation type, create a new points allocation strategy. Then, on the\nEventsView\npage,\nmodify the action for the\nTransactionAdd\nevent by replacing the existing Transaction Points Allocation\nstrategy with the new strategy. Save the changes and Reconfigure the loyalty program to reflect the changes in the live program.\nHow are tiers structured in an MLP?\nTiers are independent across programs in an MLP. Each program can have different numbers of tiers.\nCan different tiers have different eligibility criteria?\nThe eligibility criteria that you set for tier upgrade remains the same for all the subsequent tiers that you create.\nWhat happens to the status of my customer if he/she does not fulfill any of the tier eligibility criteria?\nBy default, the customer will be in the base tier of the program.\nDoes each of the renewal conditions have to be met or any one of them is enough?\nAs of now, it's an 'or' condition, so either of those conditions will result in a renewal.\nWill changing eligibility force the tiers to compute the settings for all users in advanced settings?\nYes, it depends on the tier evaluation cycle.\nCan I set an action in the workflows to send a communication to the customer after I retain the customer tier based\non conditions such as at least 10 visits or 1000 points, even if the customer has not met the tier criteria?\nYes, that action can be set in the workflows.\nIs it possible to upgrade tiers by using any other means apart from the usual upgrade conditions like a coupon or\npassing the points rule?\nAs of now, you can do this manually through member care.\nWhen I configure 26K points to upgrade a tier (say Gold), will it consider 26,000 points or 26,001 to qualify?\nWhen configuring a tier, you will only see upgrade rules greater than or equal to (>=). Hence, a customer with\n26000 points or more will be in the Gold tier.\nCan tracker values for issuance be negatively adjusted for a return if the original transaction information is not available?\nIn cases where a return occurs without reference to the original transaction, there are a few options to manage adjustments:\nImport Profiles for Downgrading Customers: To downgrade the customer's status, you can use import profiles. Currently, there are no available APIs for this process.\nManual Point Adjustments: For deducting points, you can use the manual adjustment API to perform point adjustments.\nThere is no out-of-the-box (OOB) capability to cap agent-level points. However, a custom solution can be implemented using behavioural events and loyalty promotions. Create a JIRA ticket and assign it to the Product team for guidance on this.\nDoes Tier Downgrade work in real-time?\nThe tier downgrade does not work in real-time. Instead, it operates on a 24-hour sync cycle. While tier upgrades happen in real-time, downgrades are processed within a 24-hour sync period.\nUpdated\n7 months ago"

You can have common points allocation across tiers or different allocations for each tier.\n📘\nFor\nMLP enabled orgs\n, allocation strategies created in a program are associated only with that program and cannot be used even in the org's default program.\nConfigure Points Delayed Accrual\nDelayed accrual allows issuing points to customer for an activity at a later date. For example, if you support item returns, say for a week from the purchase date, you can actually block customers from using those points before the return period. This avoids redundancy and fraud activities.\nIn Delayed Accrual, points are first issued as promised points. These cannot be redeemed by the customer. After the configured period, these points are converted and credited to the main balance.\nIn Delayed Accrual, the points allocation date is when points are actually issued to the customer. In the case of Delayed Accrual, the awarded date is when points get added to the current points (accrued date). Refer to the following examples for clarity.\nIf a transaction with bill date A is sent to Loyalty EMF on date B, the awarded date is date B.\nIf the transactionAdd activity of date A gets replayed on date B, the awarded date is date B.\nIf bill points with bill date A are imported on date B, the awarded date is date B.\n📘\nThe 'delayed accrual points' are added to the 'current points' on the next morning of the delay period, i.e., (event date + the number of days of delay) specified in the point allocation strategy.\nIf a transaction is added on 28th Sep and the number of days of delay is 1, the delayed accrual points will get added to current points on the morning of 30th Sep (morning after 28, Sep + 1 day). The awarded date is 30 Sep.\nYou can create rules on the points that are redeemable, non-redeemable, or with the summation of both.\nFind the details of event, action, and limitations of Delayed Accrual below -\nEvent name\n: DelayedAccrual. You need to configure the DelayedAccrual activity to perform actions on Delayed Accrual.\nAction\n: To enable converting promised points to current points, for the DelayedAccrual activity, you need to set\nDelayed Accrual Action\n.\nOther actions supported\n:\nSend Messages (SMS, Email, Mobile Push)\nUpgrade To Tier\nIssue Coupon\nDelayed Accrual\nLimitations\n:\nFor an activity, you cannot use both direct allocation and delayed accrual strategies. You cannot have strategies with different delay periods. For example, you cannot use one strategy with 4 days delay period and another strategy with 7 days delay period.\nYou cannot use\nDelayed Accrual\nstrategies on Registration and Customer Update activities.\nPoints unlock ability\nBy now, it is very clear that brands can give delayed points to their customers from our Loyalty settings (delayed accrual strategy). However, some times brands might want to convert these delayed points also as redeemable points for their customers.\nThe only way available to do this is via external triggers. Till now, we have this ability only for bill level. But now, we have the ability to do this even on line item levels.\nSome sample use cases:\nAs a system integrator, I would like to be able to to configure fixed return windows for different line items, allocate promised points on each line item and convert them to redeemable points according to each line item’s return window, so that the users can get regular points on each line item, as and when the return window for the line items gets over and don't have to wait for the default return windows to get over.\nAs a Loyalty Program Manager, I would like to be able to give my customer an option to end the return window for any transaction or any line item in the transaction and immediately convert promised points to regular points.\nYou can find more information on how to use this API at below link, please refer.\nPoints Unlock API\nConfigure points earn conditions\nThere are two allocation types available.\nFixed\n: A fixed number of points is allocated irrespective of the transaction amount.\nProrated\n: Points are issued as a percentage of the transaction amount or custom field value and through step function.\nBased on the chosen allocation type, you can have the following combinations of points allocation strategies.\nReward points as a percentage of a transaction amount with the same percentage across tiers. For example - Tier1: 15%, Tier2: 15%.\nReward points as a percentage of the transaction amount with different percentages for each tier. For example - Tier1: 15% of the transaction amount, Tier2: 20% of the transaction amount.\nReward a fixed number of points per transaction across tiers. For example - Tier1: 15 points per transaction, Tier2: 15 points per transaction.\nReward a fixed number of points per transaction with different values across tiers. For example - Tier1: 10 points per transaction, Tier2: 15 points per transaction.\nTo configure earning conditions, do the following.\nReward a fixed number of points in equal step sizes or transaction intervals. For example, allocate 10 points on every spend of Rs.200. So a person doing a transaction of 450 will get 20 points, because his transaction amount lies between 400 - 600.\nOn\nIntouch\n, navigate to\nMenu\n>\nLoyalty+\n>\nPrograms\n.\nIn\nPrograms\n, select the program you want to edit.\nClick\nEdit Program\n.\nClick\nPoints\n.\nClick\nAdd Earn Conditions\n.\nIn\nName\n, enter the condition name.\nIn\nDescription\n, describe the condition.\nIn\nModule Using this Condition\n, select the module (Loyalty/Campaigns - Engage+) where you want to use this condition.\n📘\nIf you choose Campaigns, you can see only two options- Fixed and Round up.\nIn\nAllocate Based On\n, select your preferred option, based on which the points are allocated.\nOption\nDescription\nTiers\nThis is the default option. Points are allocated to customers according to their tiers.\nLoyalty Registration\nPoints are allocated to customers based on the information they provide during the registration. You can select any one of the custom fields.\nFor example, if you select an age group of 25-30, points are allocated to customers belonging to this exact age group.\nLoyalty Transaction\nPoints are allocated to customers on the basis of their Loyalty transaction. For example, if you select order_channel, points are awarded only to customers who made a transaction through a particular channel(For example- Instore).\nIn\nAllocation Type\n, select your preferred allocation type to define the criteria for giving points to customers.\nOption\nDescription\nFixed\nTo reward a fixed number of points (irrespective of the transaction amount).\nFor example - 10 to issue 10 points per transaction.\nProrated- in terms of %\nTo reward points as a percentage of the transaction amount.\nFor example - 10 to issue points of 50 points if the transaction amount is 500.\nPoints Multiplier- in terms of %\nTo reward extra points to the customer along with existing points. For example, 5x of the current points allocation strategy.  This is used in promotions (run for a shorter period) along with an existing allocation strategy.\nFor example, if an org issues 10 points to customers in the lowest tier, during Diwali season the org can issue 10X points to attract customers in the lowest tier to make more purchases with the org. The customer will receive 100 points (10 multiplied by 10) if they make a transaction with org during the Diwali season.\nProrate - In terms of step function\nTo reward fixed number of points for equal transaction intervals or steps. For example, allocate 6 points on every transaction of 150. So on every step of 150, allocate 6 points. This way, transaction amount lying between 151-300 get  6 points, lying between 301-450 get 12 points and so on.\nEnable\nSame for all Tiers\nand enter the point value.\nThe point value will be the same for all the tiers in the program, If disabled, you can enter different point values for different tiers.\nIn\nEnable Delayed Accrual\n, enable the checkbox and enter the days after which the customer is able to redeem points.\nDELAYED ACCRUAL\n: Points are reflected in the customer's account immediately after the transaction but are only redeemable after the prescribed number of days. For example, if an apparel store has a return policy of seven days, and a customer buys a shirt and gets 20 points on this purchase. The points are reflected in the customer's account right after the purchase, but if the customer decides to return the shirt on the third day, the points will disappear from the account and the customer is unable to use the acquired points. Delayed accrual prevents customers from misusing points.\nClick\nDone\n.\nAllocate points on Custom Field values\nYou can also reward points to your customers based on the custom field values that are submitted on the customer registration and profile update screens of InStore.  This works only for the custom fields with integer values (example: 20) and not for string values (example: John). It is recommended to use a fixed points allocation type for custom fields.\nTo configure rewarding points based on the custom fields, do the following:\nIn\nEarn conditions\nclick\nAdd earn condition\nto create a new point earning condition (or) to modify an existing condition, navigate to the earn condition and click the respective\nedit\nbutton.\nIn\nAllocate based\non, choose either\nLoyalty Registration\nor\nLoyalty Transaction\nand select your desired custom field accordingly.\nIn the\nAllocation type\n, choose Fixed to allocate a specific number of points for every transaction (irrespective of the transaction amount). Choose Prorated to allocate points as a percentage of the transaction amount.\nClick\nDone\n.\nConfigure points round-up for campaigns\nEarn condition configuration for Campaigns has an additional Allocation type - Round up. This lets you round up points that are in a specific range for each tier. For example, when running campaigns, you can round up points that are between 30-100 to 100 for all customers in the base tier.\n📘\nIf\nSame for all Tiers\nis disabled, Round up configuration will vary for each tier.\nIn\nAllocation type\n, choose\nRoundup\n.\nIn\nPoints range\n, configure from, to, and round up to the range of points and the value that you want to have for the roundup. For example, if a customer has 40 points (current points) in his/her account and when the campaign is triggered, an additional 60 points will be added to his/her account making it 100 as configured.\nConfigure rules for points allocation strategy\nOnce you create a strategy, you need to configure the relevant activity and define rules based on which you want to execute specific points earning conditions.\nAllocation Points is an action that allows you to award points to customers based on certain activities (registration, transaction, profile update, coupon redemption, points redemption, tier upgrade).\nTo configure Rules for Points Allocation\n:\nIn\nWorkflow\n, go to Customer Activity and click TransactionAdd.\nIn\nSelect Customer Activity\n, choose the activity for which you want to define earn condition rules. While defining actions, you can choose the desired allocation strategy in Earn Condition as shown.\nYou can also set up notifications to send to customers on the successful execution of the activity. Configure SMS, email, WeChat, and/or Mobile Push templates accordingly.\nConfigure customer activity for points allocation at the transaction item level\nTo allocate points at the transaction item level, you need to have a forward case in which the transaction item is enabled. To issue points on a transaction item based on the item price enable\nUse proportions\n.\n📘\nTransaction item is available only for forward cases (Forward to set action).\nUse proportions\nand\nMaximize point allocation\noptions are visible only after you enable\nEnable transaction item\n.\nEnable transaction item\n: Enable this option to issue points at the line-item level.\nUse proportions\n: Enable this option to split points according to the price of transaction items. For example, consider a transaction with a bill amount of $300 consisting of two line items lineitem1 of $100, and lineitem2 of $200. If points allocation is 10% of the transaction amount, then 10 points will be issued for lineitem1 and 20 for lineitem2.\nMaximize point allocation\n: Enable this option to set a cap on points allocated to customers.\nEnable tender unroller\n: Enable this option to configure rules on payment modes.\nLimit points issual per customer for each set\nYou can limit points issued to customers on transaction amount, line-item amount, and tracker value for each set and subset separately per customer.\n📘\nAfter adding and deleting the capping value, click\nSave\n.\nThe following are the different capping configurations supported.\nTotal Points capping: Limit the maximum amount of points allocated to a customer across all actions inside a set and all its subsets. This is applicable for all sets of the TransactionAdd customer activity.\nTo limit total points per customer for a condition in the TransactionAdd customer activity, do the following.\nOn Workflow, select TransactionAdd customer activity. Click +Add capping.\nIn Add capping page, click Total points.\nIn Total points, set the limit per customer.\nClick Save.\nSource value capping\nSet a limit on the value based on which points are calculated and awarded to customers. For example, if there is x% discount on bill amount and source value is set as 5000, the customer receives x% on bill amount or x% on 5000 as points (whichever is lower). This is applicable for Set1 and its subsets of the TransactionAdd customer activity.\nTo limit points per customer for a condition in the TransactionAdd customer activity.\nOn Workflow, select TransactionAdd customer activity. Click +Add capping.\nIn Add capping page, click Source value.\nIn Source value, set the limit per customer.\nClick Save.\nSum of tender amounts\nThis option lets you limit points based on eligible payment methods. For example, issue points for the payments through ABC credit card up to 10000 of the cumulative transaction amount (from the configured time).\nThis is applicable for Set1 and its sub-sets of the TransactionAdd customer activity.\nTo limit points per customer on tracker values TransactionAdd customer activity.\nOn Workflow, select TransactionAdd customer activity. Click +Add capping.\nIn Add capping page, click Sum of tender amount.\nIn Sum of tender amount, enable/disable the toggle button to include/exclude the tender mode. Choose the tender mode from the drop-down options.\nClick Save.\nTracker source value\nThis option is available for TrackerSet to limit issuing points on tracker value. For example, you can have a tracker condition to capture the quantity of petrol and limit points to issue per customer for up to 1000 liters of petrol. You can define multiple tracker conditions for a set.\nThis is applicable only for the sub-sets of TrackerSet (TransactionAdd customer activity).\nTo limit points per customer on tracker values:\nOn Workflow, select TransactionAdd customer activity.\nSelect sub-set of TrackerSet,  click +Add capping.\nIn the Add capping page, click Tracker source.\nChoose the Tracker for which you want to set the limit. After selecting the tracker a text box appears.\nEnter the capping value in the text box.\nExpiry Conditions\nTo configure expiry conditions, do the following.\nOn Intouch, navigate to\nMenu > Loyalty+ > Programs\n.\nIn Programs, select the program you want to edit.\nSelect\nEdit Program\n.\nSelect\nReward currency\n.\nClick\nAdd Expiry Conditions\n.\nIn Name, enter the condition name.\nIn Description, describe the condition.\nIn Select module for this condition, select the module (Loyalty+/Engage+) for which the condition is applicable.\nIn Expire Pts. Based on, select your preferred option to define the criteria for points expiry.\nOption\nDescription\nEvent Date\nPoints expire on the configured date based on the last activity (transaction/registration) done by the customer. For example, if a customer buys a shirt on June 10, 2021, then the validity period for points for this customer can be set on any day after this transaction was made.\nRolling Expiry from Event Date\nThe current date of points expiry is reset to a new date based on the recent transaction date. That is, if a customer earns points before the expiry of existing points, the validity of all points will reset to the new points expiry date.\nFor example, if a customer who made a transaction on June 10, 2021, has their point expiring on July 10, 2021, but they again made a transaction on July 7, 2021, then customers’ existing points along with the newly acquired point will have a new validity period, based on the transaction made on July 7, 2021.\nNote: Only the points that were issued via rolling strategies are extended.\nMembership Event Date\nPoints expire automatically when the membership expires. This is usually used for membership-based loyalty. For example, if a customer has subscribed to a Platinum membership with a Digital store, and has his/her membership expiring in January 2022, then the points earned by this customer also expire in January 2022.\nCustomer's registration date\nPoints will expire on the registration date of the customer. This registration date refers to the date on which customer got enrolled or registered into the loyalty program. This will be same for all tiers.\nFixed date\nPoints will expire on a fixed date. This fixed date will be selected here, and every year points will expire on this date. This will be same for all tiers.\nTransaction extended field\nPoints expire based on the date provided by the selected transaction-extended field.\nThis capability supports time units (days, months). The date in the selected extended field will have the specified time unit added to it, and that final date becomes the expiry date of the points.\nIf the calculated expiry date is in the past, the system sets the expiry to 7 days from the event processing date instead of failing the event.\nNote:\nAs this is a transaction-extended field where the value of the field will be coming via a transaction this is available only for the loyalty module when creating the expiry strategy.\nCustomer extended field\nPoints expire based on the date in the selected customer-extended field. This capability supports time units (days, months). The date in the selected extended field will have the specified time unit added to it, and that final date becomes the expiry date of the points.\nIf the calculated expiry date is in the past, the system sets the expiry to 7 days from the event processing date instead of failing the event.\nNote:\nAs this customer-extended field is independent of the transaction, it is available in both the loyalty and engage modules when creating the expiry strategy.\nEnable Same for all Tiers.\nIn Time Unit, select your preferred option to set the validity period for points.\nOption\nDescription\nDays\nPoints expire after the configured number of days.\nFor example, if a customer makes a transaction on July 1, 2021, and the Days for expiry is set as 10, points will expire on July 11, 2021.\nMonths\nPoints expire after the configured number of months.\nNOTE: Points will expire only on the last day of the month,\nFor example, if a customer makes a transaction on July 10, 2021, and Months for expiry is set as 1, points will expire on August 31, 2021.\nDate\nPoints expire on the configured date.\nFor example, if a customer makes a transaction on June 1, 2021, and the Date for expiry is set as August 10, 2021, then points will expire on this fixed date only.\nNever\nPoints will never expire for the customer.\nIn Expire Pts. at the end of, enter the days or number of months for points to expire.\nFor Date, you have to select a date on which points expire. For Never, there is no configuration required.\nClick Done.\nCreate Redeem Conditions\nRedeem conditions allow you to configure points conversion ratio, eligibility criteria, and limit for points redemption. The eligibility criteria could be current points, lifetime points, or lifetime purchases.\nYou can configure points redemption to do the following.\nSet-point conversion ratio\nDefine the minimum points a customer should earn.\nLimit the number of points redemption per transaction.\nRedeem points in multiples of 'X'.\nExample\nCustomers need at least 150-lifetime points to be eligible for redeeming points\nRedemption is allowed only in multiples of 50, and\nA maximum of 100 points can be redeemed per transaction\nAt least one redemption strategy should be created in a loyalty program. An error is shown if you run the loyalty program without any points redemption strategy.\nFor MLP, points redemption strategies created in a program cannot be used in other org programs, not even in the org's default program.\nTo configure redeem conditions, do the following\n-\nOn\nIntouch\n, navigate to\nMenu\n>\nLoyalty+\n>\nPrograms\n.\nIn\nPrograms\n, select the program you want to edit.\nClick\nEdit Program\nClick\nPoints\n.\nIn\nHow much is each point worth?\n, specify the points conversion ratio (in terms of org's base currency).

Based on the number of decimals configured, the rounding is considered up to those decimal places. For example, if the round-off is set to two decimal places, the rounding would be for the nearest hundredths.\nThe types of strategies for rounding are as follows:\nCeiling\n: Rounds numbers towards positive infinity. Positive numbers round-up, while negative numbers round down (towards zero).\nFloor\n: Rounds numbers towards negative infinity. Positive numbers round down, while negative numbers round down.\nRound Half Up\n: Rounds to the nearest value, rounding up when the next digit is five or more.  If the decimal is 5 (midway), then it is rounded up.\nRound Half Down\n: Rounds to the nearest value, rounding up when the next digit is five or more.  If the decimal is 5 (midway), then it is rounded down.\nRound Half Even\n: Rounds to the nearest value, rounding to the nearest even number when the next digit is exactly five.\nFor example, 25.8751 points are to be allocated to a customer and the round-off is set to two decimal places, The following table highlights the value of points that will be issued based on the round off strategy:\nRound Strategy\nCeiling\nFloor\nHalf Up (Default)\nHalf Down\nHalf Even\nPoints round-up (25.8751)\n25.88\n25.87\n25.88\n25.87\n25.88\nFAQs\nCan I limit the number of times my customer can earn points?\nYou can limit the number of points a customer can earn in the points earning condition.

To configure Tier upgrade notification, do the following.\nEnable the tier/tiers to which the customer gets upgraded.\n📘\nFor example, you enable\nUpgrades to Tier 3\n, customers will receive a message before they get upgraded to Tier 3 via any configured channel.\nClick\nAdd Creative\nfor channels to configure a tier upgrade message. You can choose from existing templates or create a new creative. But for Wechat, only the existing templates can be used.\nChannel\nReference Link\nSMS\nCreate SMS Template\nEmail\nCreate Email Template\nMobile Push\nCreate Mobile Push Template\nWeChat\nCreate WeChat Template\nTier Renewal\nEnable your preferred option to alert the customer before or after the tier renewal or tier downgrade.\nNote\n: The customer will not receive tier renewal/downgrade notifications if you have not configured tier renewal conditions.\n📘\nYou can add and configure multiple alerts for tier downgrade. The alert is only sent if customers meet certain conditions.\nOption\nDescription\nAlert ____ Days before Renewal Check\nCustomers are alerted before the configured days before tier renewal. For example, if a customer's tier is to be renewed on June 15, 2021, and you configure\nAlert 7 Days before Renewal Check\n, then customers will receive an alert on June 8, 2021.\nAlert Immediately after Renewal\nCustomers receive an alert immediately after their tier is renewed.\nAlert Immediately after Downgrade\nCustomers receive an alert immediately after they are downgraded to a lower tier.\nPoints Expiry\nTo define communication for when points get expired for each tier, do the following.\nIn\nAlert\n, enter the number of days before the customer is alerted about tier downgrade.\n📘\nIf there are no renewal conditions set up, then renewal/downgrade reminder messages will NOT be sent out.\nIn\nOnly when the following criteria are true\n, enable your preferred option and enter the desired value.\nOption\nDescription\nCumulative Points\nCustomers will receive an alert only if their lifetime points are greater than the configured value.\nPurchases\nCustomers will receive an alert only if their lifetime purchases are greater than the configured value.\nCurrent points\nCustomers will receive an alert only if their current points are greater than the configured value.\nExpiry Points\nCustomers will receive an alert only if their expiry points are greater than the configured value.\nIn\nAnd belongs to any of these tiers\n, enable the desired tier(s).\nClick\nSave & Continue\n.\n📘\nCustomers belonging to the enabled tier(s) will only receive the alert message.\nAdvanced Settings\nThese settings help increase productivity by reaching out to customers based on your org's preferred channel (mandatory) and other channels based on customers'  availability in the order of priority. This can also minimize the cost of communication by reaching out to cheap communication channels and maximize the probability of conversion by prioritizing channels that could give better ROI.\nTo configure communication settings, follow these steps.\nOn\nIntouch\n, navigate to\nMenu\n>\nLoyalty+\n>\nPrograms\n.\nIn Programs, select the program for which you want to set the communication setting and click\nEdit Program\n>\nAdvanced settings\n.\nIn the\nCommunication Channels\n, enable the Setup Communication toggle button to set mandatory channels and priority channels.\nMandatory Channels\n: Channels that are mandatory for sending the notifications\nPriority Channels\n: Channels that need to be triggered based on priority and availability. For example, if Mobile is set as priority 1, Mobile Push as priority 2, and email as priority 3, the system first checks whether SMS is configured and then checks if the mobile number is available for the customer. If anyone fails, then it will try to send the notification through mobile push and so on.\nFor example, consider for a tier upgrade event, SMS is set as a Mandatory Channel and the priority channels are eMail (1) and WeChat (2). When a tier is upgraded for the customers mentioned in the following table, notifications are sent based on the channel availability and configuration settings as explained below.\nChannel\nSMS\neMail\nWeChat\nCustomer A\nMa\nEa\nWa\nCustomer B\nMb\n-\nWb\nCustomer C\n-\nEc\n-\nCustomer A will get an SMS on Ma and an eMail on Ea.\nCustomer B will get an SMS on Mb and a WeChat message on Wb.\nCustomer C will not get an SMS and gets an eMail on Ec.\nClick Done.\n📘\nChannels that are selected in Mandatory Channels will not appear in Priority Channels and vice versa.\nFor notifications configured for external sources such as Facebook, if a specific channel is not available for a customer, then the notification is sent through identifiers available in internal sources (such as mobile no. and WeChat). For example, consider that an org (that is in both internal and external channels) wants to send an SMS for a Facebook event. Based on the channel availability on a customer's Facebook account, notifications are sent as explained in the following.\nSource\nFacebook (External)\nEcrm (Internal)\nCustomer A\nMaf\nMae\nCustomer B\nMbf\n-\nCustomer C\n-\nMce\nIf an SMS notification is sent for a Facebook event:\nCustomer A gets a message on mobile Maf.\nCustomer B gets a message on mobile Mbf.\nCustomer C gets a message on mobile Mce.\nIf an SMS is sent for an eCRM event:\nCustomer A gets a message on mobile Mae.\nCustomer B won’t get any message.\nCustomer C gets a message on mobile Mce.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nTier Upgrade\nTier Renewal\nPoints Expiry\nAdvanced Settings"

For the advanced settings regarding payment methods and friends & family programs, read below.\nPayment Mode Settings\nTo incentivize based on the payment mode combination, you need to configure these steps.\nAdd supported payment modes for the org\nCreate required payment modes.\nConfigure Rulesets for a customer activity (on the Workflow) to define what action to perform for a tender combination.\nCreate a payment method\nA payment method combination will have a mode of payment, an attribute, and the corresponding attribute value.\nExample:\nCard, Bank Name: ICICI, Card tier: Gold (Mode: Card, Attribute: Bank name, Value: Card type)\nDiscountCoupon, CouponType: Ticket (Mode: Discount Coupon, Attribute: Sodexo)\nThe Payment methods tab lets you create different payment mode combinations and incentivize customers with points or coupons based on payment mode combinations. You need to configure actions to perform for each payment mode strategy on the Workflow page.\n📘\nIn the case of MLP, tender combinations created in a loyalty program cannot be used in any other programs of the org, not even in the org default program.\nTo allocate points based on the payment method, follow these steps.\n📘\nBefore proceeding with payment method configuration, ensure that your org has payment modes added as explained here.\nLog in to\nIntouch\n, navigate to\nMenu\n>\nLoyalty+\n>\nPrograms\n.\nIn\nPrograms\n, select the program for which you want to set the payment method setting and click\nEdit Program\n>\nAdvanced settings\n.\nNavigate to the\nPayment methods\npage.\nEnable the toggle button to restrict points allocation based on payment methods.\nIn\nName\n, specify a name for the payment method.\nIn\nPayment mode\n, choose the type of payment mode.\nClick\nAdd attribute\n, you will see the list of attributes of the payment mode.\nIn\nAttribute\n, choose the desired attribute from the drop-down list.\nIn\nValue\n, choose the desired attribute value (Values option appears only for supported attributes).\nEnable point maximization using the toggle button to make the payment method is eligible for points maximization (in Workflows).\nClick\nDone\n.\n(DEPRECATED) Group Loyalty Settings (Friends & Family)\nYou can enable transferring points for a customer activity using a group loyalty setting.\n❗️\nDeprecated\nThis feature is deprecated and no more in use.\nTo enable tier sync and transferring points for a customer activity, follow these steps.\nLog in on\nIntouch\n, navigate to\nMenu\n>\nLoyalty+\n>\nPrograms\n.\nIn Programs, select the program for which you want to set the group loyalty setting and click\nEdit Program\n>\nAdvanced settings\n.\nIn the\nFriends & family program\n, enable the Tier sync toggle button to set all members in the family group to have the same tier similar to the primary member.\nEnable the\nEnable points contribution by a secondary member\ntoggle button. You will see the list of customer activities.\nEnable the toggle button for each customer activity for which you want to activate points transfer. All the option names are self-explanatory.\nClick\nDone\n.\nSetting delay accural based on bill date or processing date\nWe all know, delayed accrual feature allows issuing points to customers for an activity at a later date. Now the calculation of this delayed accrual is an interesting one. This is because, even though a transaction happened on X date, it will be processed on a Y date in our capillary system.\nLet’s understand this with an example:\nBrand configured the delayed accrual as : 10 days\nCase 1\n: Customer made transaction on 10th May 2023\nCase 2:\nCapillary system processed the transaction on 12th May 2023\nNow, if the delayed accrual is calculated based on case 1, points will be issued on 20th May 2023\nIf the delayed accrual is calculated based on case 2, points will be issued on 22nd May 2023.\nBrands have the ability to configure the delayed accrual strategy as per their policies (Bill date or Event processing date). This option will be available in the advanced loyalty setting of the Loyalty+.\nUpdated\n9 months ago\nTable of Contents\nPayment Mode Settings\nCreate a payment method\n(DEPRECATED) Group Loyalty Settings (Friends & Family)\nSetting delay accural based on bill date or processing date"

You can use extended fields with datatypes Integer or Double.\nLine-item extended field\nCreate tracker cases on a transaction line-item-level extended field. You can use extended fields with datatypes Integer or Double.\nIn the\nTracking Method\n, select any of the following methods to track entities.\nMethod\nDescription\nMoving Window\nIn Moving Window mode, when a customer makes a transaction, the tracker condition is checked for the previous X days or months (number of days or months set in\nTrack for ___ days/months\n) until the transaction date.\nBased on the cycle in which a transaction falls, the tracker cases are evaluated from starting of that cycle until the transaction date. Consider the following examples:\nMoving window (days):\nA tracker was set up on April 5, 2025, to reward 200 bonus points if a customer spends $1000 within a 20-day period. For each transaction, the system looks back 20 days to calculate the total spend. So, for a purchase made on April 7, the tracker checks spend from March 18 to April 7. For a purchase on May 4, it checks from April 15 to May 4, and so on.\nThis means the window shifts with every transaction, and the set of transactions included in the calculation can change daily.\nMoving window (months):\nA tracker was set up on April 5, 2025, to reward 200 bonus points if a customer spends $1000 within a 3-month period. With month-based logic, the system includes full calendar months in the tracker window. So, if purchases are made on April 10 and June 10, the system considers spend from April 1 to June 30. If another purchase is made on July 1, the window shifts forward—dropping April—and now includes May 1 to July 31. This approach ensures more stable and predictable tracking by updating only once per month.\nCyclic Window\nIn Cyclic Window mode, when a customer makes a transaction for the first time after the tracker is configured, cycles of equal intervals are created for that customer based on the transaction date. The duration of each cycle depends on the value set in\nTrack for ___ days\n.\nBased on the cycle in which a transaction falls, the tracker cases are evaluated from starting of that cycle until the transaction date. Consider the following example:\nA tracker was created on Apr 5, 2019, with a condition to reward a bonus of 200 points on a transaction of $1000 in 20 days (\nTrack for ___ days\n).\nAssume that a customer makes subsequent transactions on Apr 7, May 4, 10, and 22.\n- In Cyclic Window mode, based on the first transaction date (Apr 7) of the customer (after the strategy is configured), cycles are created with equal intervals of 20 days each.For the first transaction ( Apr 7) the condition is checked only for that day. As the second transaction falls in Cycle 2 (May 4), the condition is checked from starting of the second cycle until the transaction day (Apr 27 - May 4). Similarly, the fourth transaction falls in Cycle 3 and the condition is checked from May 27 - May 22.\nCalendar Based Cyclic Window\nCycles of calendar months are created based on the Start Date and the number of months set irrespective of the transaction date.\nFor example, if a Calendar based Cyclic Window is created with the start date Apr 5 and the number of months 3, then the cycles are created for three calendar months as shown in the illustration below. Then, based on the date of the transaction, the corresponding cycle will be considered.\nTier Change Window\nCalculates tracker values considering the last tier change date. For example, if a customer's tier changed on Aug 2, 2020, tracker values will be calculated from Aug 2, 2020, until the current date.\n📘\nTrackers need to be incorporated in Workflows to define when they need to be evaluated and what happens when the milestone conditions are met.\nIn\nCase Name\n, enter the name for the current tracker case.\nUnder\nTrack For\n, enter the duration of the window to evaluate the tracker case.\nSelect a\nUnit\nfrom the dropdown menu, choosing between months or days.\nIn\nWhat are the tracker's milestones\n, select any of the following options for two fields and enter the desired value.\nDefine the condition of that tracker case in this field. For example, if the Sum of transactions in\n365 days\nare\nEqual to$1000\n.\nField 1\n:\nOption\nDescription\nSum\nIt is the total of tracked entity values for the specified duration.\nFor example for Bill Amount, the sum is the total value of all transactions (amount) tracked for a set duration.\nCount\nIt is the number of times the entity is tracked in a specified duration.\nFor example, for Bill Amount, the count is the number of transactions tracked for a specified time period.\nField 2\n:\nOption\nDescription\nEqual to\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is the same as the configured value\nGreater than\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is more than the configured value.\nLess than\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is less than the configured value.\nGreater than or Equal to\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is either equal to or more than the configured value.\nLess than or Equal to\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is either equal to or less than the configured value.\nMod of\nBetween\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count falls between the two configured values.\nEnable\nLimit No. of forwards per customer\nand enter the value to limit the execution of the current tracker case.\n📘\nOnce the case is executed successfully for X times for a customer (where X is the value specified in this field), the tracker case will not be evaluated for that customer again.\nYou can add multiple tracker cases by clicking\nAdd Tracker Case\n.\nClick\nSave\n.\n📘\nYou can see the configured tracker case in\nPreview\n.\nEditing a Tracker\nTo edit a tracker, follow these steps:\nIn the Intouch homepage, go to\nLoyalty+\n>\nPrograms\n.\nIn\nPrograms\n, scroll down and select the program you want to edit.\nClick\nEdit Program\nand scroll down to the\nTrackers\nsection.\nClick\nTrackers\n, select the menu button next to the tracker you want to edit, and choose\nEdit\n.\nMake the necessary changes and select\nSave\n.\nThe tracker is now edited successfully.\n📘\nNote\nWhen editing the name or case name for a tracker, update the same name under the tracker sets and point tracker sets under the\nworkflow section\nif used.\nAdding Trackers in Workflows\nOnce you create a tracker strategy, it is important to configure rule sets to start tracking entities set in tracker strategies, evaluate tracker cases, and trigger actions upon successful execution of tracker cases.\nTo configure tracker-based rules, go to the\nWorkflows\npage and select\nMakes a transaction\n(Transaction Add) customer activity (It is usually going to be the activity selected by default).\nThe first parent set (Set1) is for new transaction activity, the second one is the TrackerSet where you can define rules on tracker cases. The last parent set is for the transaction finished activity.\nWhen a transaction is made, the first set is invoked and forwards to the second set. The second set validates all the trackers and executes actions based on the rules and actions configured. The event then gets forwarded to the third set which completes the transaction event.\nTo create tracker based rules, do the following\n:\nOn the\nEventsView\npage, choose\nTransactionAdd\nevent and navigate to TrackerSet.\nClick\n+Condition\n.\nLeave\nExpression\nand\nExpression equals\nto true.\nIn the\nWhen\nfield, click + and select the default\nForward to\nSet action using\n+Add action\n> Click\nSave\n>\nEnable transaction item\n> Click\nSave\n.\nA new tracker is created under the TrackerSet as shown above. The tracker name is generated by default. You cannot modify the tracker name. You can tag a tracker strategy to the tracker. Tag a tracker strategy to the tracker as explained in the following.\nNavigate to the child tracker set. In the\nWhen\ncondition click + and Select the\nTracker Evaluation\naction and click Save.\nIn\nAdd tracker evaluation action\n, choose the tracker case for which you want to configure rules.\nIn\nTrackers\n(Action field), choose the tracker strategy that you want to tag for the tracker and click\nSave\n.\nSimilarly, you can create multiple child tracker sets under the parent set. To know how to configure rules, see\nConfiguring Events\n.\nUsing Trackers in Tiers\nTrackers offer very powerful means of controlling tier eligibilities and renewal conditions based on recency, for example, you can upgrade a customer based on visits in the last 1 year or purchases in a calendar month and renew based on purchases made as part of Gold Tier.\nTo setup:\nSelect “Tracker” as part of Eligibility criteria or Renewal Conditions.\nYou will also be required to select a ‘Tracker Case’, however this is only for the purpose of the tracking duration - the values for eligibility or renewal are as per the values set in the tier strategy and not the milestones.\nYou will still need to include the Tracker and properly set it up inside workflows for the values to be evaluated and the the tier upgrades to work smoothly\n📘\nIt is recommended that “Tier Change Window” type trackers are used for Renewal in most cases\nMilestone based Loyalty using Trackers\nYou can setup the Loyalty Program to be able to celebrate milestones as part of the customer’s journey in the Loyalty Program or during certain seasonal time periods. For example, you can award a coupon to a customer if they make 5 visits within the first year of membership or 500 bonus points to a customer on shopping for $1000 once they reach the Gold Tier.\nTo setup, you can create the milestones  by setting up all 4 steps inside the Tracker as explained above. You can then set the appropriate actions inside the different Tracker Case rulesets.\n📘\nOne Tracker can have multiple milestones\nPoints Allocation inside Trackers\nWhen you allocate points inside trackers, using the percentage allocation method, whatever is the tracked entity becomes the source value.\nUpdated\nabout 13 hours ago\nTable of Contents\nCreating Trackers\nEditing a Tracker\nAdding Trackers in Workflows\nUsing Trackers in Tiers\nMilestone based Loyalty using Trackers\nPoints Allocation inside Trackers"

Read more about Customer Activities\nhere.\nSelect Scope in each set to apply filters based on date range, event type, cluster, zone, and store.\nSelect Reward currency limit to apply limit points issued to customers on transaction amount, line-item amount, and tracker value for each set and subset separately per customer.\nWhen the event scope is set, navigate to the condition pane to create rules and define actions to be executed.\nClick any selected Action to set up channel notifications. Read more about Actions\nhere\n.\nRead below to understand each of these steps in detail.\nChoose customer activity\nTo configure rules for different customer activities, do the following.\nOn\nIntouch\n, navigate to\nLoyalty+\n>\nPrograms\n. In\nPrograms\n, select the program you want to reconfigure. Click\nReconfigure Program\nand click\nWorkflow\n.\nIn the\nCustomer Activity\nclick the event name, choose the event for which you want to configure rules. To know about different available events, see Understanding Events.\nAdd Scope to filter customer activity\nTo add scope, do the following.\nClick\nScope\nto apply filters based on date range, event type, cluster, zone, and store.

If no sources/accounts are selected, then the current rules will apply to all accounts.\nSupported methods for rules: currentCustomer.isLoyal, currentCustomer.hasInstoreProfile, currentCustomer.hasWeChatProfile\nLimit issual of points\nYou can set limits on the points issued per customer for each set or subset. The total points issued to a customer can be limited from based on the transaction value and payment method.\n📘\nNote\nThe limiting of points is only applicable for the\n**TransactionAdd**\ncustomer activity.\nTo configure points capping, follow these steps:\nNavigate to a loyalty program and select\nEdit Program\nNavigate to the\nWorkflows\nsection.\nSelect\nTransactionAdd\nunder the\nCustomer Activity\nsection.\nChoose the ruleset and select\nReward currency limit\n.\nSelect the capping type and enter the capping values.\nThe types of capping are as follows:\nType\nDescription\nMaximum Total rewards for reward allocation\nLimit the total number of points that can be issued.\nMaximum Source value allocation\nLimit the source value amount for a\ntracker\n.\nEligible Payment method for rewards\nLimit the total number of points that can be issued for a specified payment method.\nSelect\nSave\nto confirm the changes.\nSelect\nSave and Continue\nto save the changes.\n📘\nNotes\nLimiting points based on the payment method is supported for the\nEvaluation Start\nruleset.\nFor advanced capping configurations, refer to documentation on\nadvanced capping\n.\nConfigure Rulesets\nTo configure rulesets, do the following.\nThe sets are categorized for better understanding. There are four categories in the TransactionAdd event and one in remaining customer activities.\nEvaluation Start\n: The evaluation of the event or activity will start from the sets within this category. This set processes each record or line item in the event and executes various actions such as points allocation, issuing a coupon to the customer, enrolling the customer in subscriptions, sending a message, or upgrading the tier of the customer.\nTrackers :\nThe trackers created in the program will be evaluated here. In this set, brands can award points or execute the mentioned actions by tracking the event and its attributes within a specific window To evaluate the trackers add “forward to set” actions and select the trackers to be evaluated.\nPoints trackers:\nOnce a points tracker is created, it is always available for rule writing in the above sets. The linking of the points tracker here upgrades the customer based on defined points tracker values. All points of a customer are tracked irrespective of the rules written here.\nEvaluation end:\nThis set is designed to execute follow-up actions after the successful processing of the above events, such as sending SMS or email notifications since you want to send them once only. It allows for various additional actions to be performed. However, be mindful that points allocation and other related actions should be completed in the previous sets to ensure the accurate inclusion of tags in your messages.\nWhen the event scope is set, navigate to the condition pane to create rules and define actions to be executed. You can create multiple conditions using\n+ Condition\nin the\nAll Conditions\npane.\nClick on\nCondition\nto add a new condition to the rule. A condition is a combination of rule expression, expression validation (When), and action (executed based on the expression value). Refer to the following steps to define a condition.\nIn the\nExpression\nbox, write the condition to evaluate. See the supported Profiles for each event and the relevant profile attributes and operators used in rule expressions. Also, see the section below on writing rules to better understand how to do it.\nClick\n+ When\nand choose the expression result (\nExpression\nis True or False) and set the action to be executed. You can set actions either for success case or for failure case, i.e., you can set actions to be executed either for expression result true or for false.\nExpression is\n: Set when to execute the action - when the result of the expression is satisfied (True) or not satisfied (False).\n📘\nIf you want to execute rules as per your loyalty program configuration, specify 'true' in the expression box and Expression equals box. Then, select the action to be performed.\n+ Action\n: Click to show the supported actions and select the action to be performed for the given condition.\nBased on the selected action, you will see some relevant options that need to be configured. Here, you can create a new strategy (by clicking\nNew\n) or choose the existing strategies. for example, to choose the points allocation strategy you want to apply for the program.\nClick on any selected\nAction\nto set up channel notifications using different channels. For example, in the following example clicking\nAllocation Points\nallows you to configure mandatory or priority channels for the allocation points action.\n📘\nChannels that are selected in Mandatory Channels will not appear in Priority Channels and vice versa.\nClick\nSave\nto save the changes made in the loyalty program.\nClick\nPublish Changes\nto apply changes to the loyalty program. If you do not reconfigure the loyalty program, the new changes will not reflect in the loyalty program.\nActivity level Capping & Capping in a time period - In Transaction Add event\nRestrict the Regular as well as promotional points at the entire transaction activity & in a specific time period. This works on top of all the set level points cappings.\nUse Cases\nMax 1000 points in a transaction including promotional points OR\nMax 500 base points and 200 promotional points\nMax 10000 points in 30 days for a customer\nMax 500 points in a week\nCAPPING ON A TRANSACTION :\nGetting started\nGo to Loyalty → Workflows → Activity reward currency limit\nA tab on top of the workflows namely “Activity reward currency limit” will be visible. Users can define the limits for regular and promotional points for the transaction add customer activity.\nThe capping value can be set for regular or promotional points or both.\nRefer the below Gif to use Activity level capping.\nCAPPING IN A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD :\nGetting started\nGo to Loyalty+ → Workflows → Activity reward currency limit → Select milestone\nIf the milestone group and milestones within that group are already created, simply choose from them. If there are no milestone groups or milestones created, you can click on the “Go to  ” and create a milestone group.\nWhile creating the milestone group, choose the “Limit benefit for customer activity” option under the milestone type, along with milestone evaluation type and frequency.\nCreate the milestone periods and save. Within the milestone groups, create milestones and set the “reward currency limit” for regular or promotional points or both.\nThese milestones will then appear in the new “Activity reward currency limit” tab and multiple milestones can be selected. At a time, at this customer level, only 3 capping criterions can be selected.\nTo set the specific time period, in which points will be capped, you will have to create a milestone group for that time period. In the Milestone Loyalty module (Organization settings >> Sales milestone) a second type of milestone group can be created called “Limit benefit for customer activity”.\nRefer to the GIFs below.\n→ Selection of milestones in “Activity reward currency limit” tab in Loyalty workflows\n→ Creation of Milestone Group\n→ Creation of Milestones within a “limit currency type” milestone group:\nUpdated\n5 months ago\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\nChoose customer activity\nAdd Scope to filter customer activity\nLimit issual of points\nConfigure Rulesets\nActivity level Capping & Capping in a time period - In Transaction Add event\nUse Cases\nCAPPING ON A TRANSACTION :\nGetting started\nCAPPING IN A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD :\nGetting started"

It is very common in the US as brands want to keep their point liabilities as low as possible.\nPay with points is considered a premium feature in the US market. Just converting points into rewards and points into a voucher is considered normal.\nSimplicity for brand and customers. Brands don't have to deal with redemption of points, or security like OTP, redemption reversal, etc. Customers don't have to manage points and make a lot of decisions to get the same amount of benefit. Saves a lot of operational hassle. Points redemption is one of the top 5 issues that we get on a monthly basis mostly OTP.\nHere is the step-by-step guide.\nOn Intouch, navigate to\nLoyalty+ > Programs\n. In Programs, select the program you want to reconfigure.\nIn the\nCustomer Activity\nclick the event name, and choose the event “\nConvertPointsToReward\n”. To know about different available events, see Understanding Events.\nIn the workflow add set/conditions and rule expressions respective to your use case, and click to select a boolean output value true/false.\nIf the configured condition output is true, the actions will be performed. To configure the auto conversion of points into reward action click on\n+Add action\nto add the\n“Issue catalog reward”\nand save.\nOnce the\n“Issue catalog reward”\naction is saved, a dropdown window will appear to choose the Organization name and the Reward Configured.\nOnce the configuration is done, click on\nsave and Continue\nOnce the transaction is done by the customer, automatically the threshold points will convert and a reward configured will be issued to the customer.\nFor creating rewards, please do the below steps:\nCreate a Coupon, for reference\nclick here\nLet's say a coupon series of 100 off, which generates the series_id = 100203, Once the coupon is generated we can link it with the reward created at the Marvel end.\nTo create a reward at Reward Catalog (aka Marvel), click here for the guide -\nMARVEL\nOnce the coupon is created, the coupon/offer is linked via series ID with the reward so now we can link the reward with the \"auto points conversion to reward activity\"\n📘\nNote\nAuto points conversion to reward are not get triggered for the below events:\nImport related activities\nGoodwill allocation\nBulk Allocate Points\nUnlock points API\nUpdated\n10 months ago\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nBackground\nWhy auto-convert points to coupons?\nHere is the step-by-step guide.\nFor creating rewards, please do the below steps:"

You can allocate points on the transaction amount. You can also have common points allocation across tiers or different allocations for each tier.\nTo configure the Transaction point allocation action, follow these steps.\nSelect\nTransaction point allocation\nand click\nSave\n.\nIn the\nEarn condition\n, choose the desired condition from the drop-down list.\nTo create a new condition, click on\n+ Add Condition\n.\nIn the\nZero earn condition\n, choose an appropriate condition from the drop-down.\nNote:\nThe configuration for the zero earn condition is not determined by these options and depends on the other configurations explained\nhere\n.\nSelect the\nExpiry condition\nfrom the drop-down menu.\nTo create a new Expiry earn condition from scratch, click\n+ Add condition\n.\nIn\nProrate on\n, choose on what basis you want to issue a percentage of points - transaction amount or event value. This is applicable only for prorated points allocation. If bill amount, choose a current event, if tracker, choose current aggregate or previous aggregate\nAmount\n: Choose this to allocate prorated points on the transaction amount.\nCurrent aggregate\n: Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker post the current transaction. This is disabled in Evaluations start and Evaluation end sets.\nPrevious aggregate\n: Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker before the current transaction. This is disabled in Evaluations start and Evaluation end sets.\nIn the\nPoints rounding strategy\n, you can choose which points rounding strategy you prefer using from the drop-down list. Points rounding strategy informs how many decimal points to use when allocating points to customers.\nActual\n: Issues the actual number of points as configured in the prorated condition. For example, the customer will receive 19.9 points for the transaction amount of 199, if the points allocation condition is set as 10%.\nFloor\n: Evaluate and assign the values without considering the decimal value. For example, assume customers should receive 10% of points for transactions. If a customer has purchased for $199, instead of 19.9 points, the customer will receive 19 points.\nRound\n: Determine the number of decimal points you want to support for decimal points. Zero is for no decimal, one is for one, two is for two, and three is for three decimal points.\nSelect\nDelay strategy\n: Following are the different delayed-accrual (or point conversion strategies) that are currently available for the brands to use.\nAs defined in the allocation strategy:\nPoints are assigned based on the conditions defined in the allocation strategy. If no conditions are defined, points will be directly issued as current points.\nFixed delay days from item return period:\nBased on the return period configured against the product, issue the promised points as current points once the return period expires. For example, assume for a transaction with a return period of 7 days, the customer is promised to get 1000 points. These promised points will be converted into current points after 7 days i.e. after the return period is over.\nAvailable only for transaction-based customer activities.\nFixed delay days from the line-item extended field:\nBased on the value of the line-item extended field that is selected in the drop-down. Say, there is a line-item extended field called \"ABC\" & this is selected in the drop-down of \"delay strategy\" during the point allocation action after selecting this delay strategy. Now, say a user made a transaction & the value of this field is arrived as 10. Then the points that are being allocated from that action will have a delayed accrual of 10 days.\nAvailable only for transaction-based customer activities, and the line-item extended field should mandatorily come from the transaction payload.\nOn external trigger:\nIssue points at the event of “transaction add” as promised points and convert them at the event of “transaction update”. For example: In hospitals, promised points will be issued immediately when you make a booking and will be converted into current points when the bill is settled.\nAvailable only for transaction-based customer activities.\nBased on the behavioral event attribute\n: Based on the date that is coming via the attribute of the behavioral event. Assume, there is a behavioral \"ABC\" that has 3 attributes (X, a date type attribute; Y, a customer identifier attribute; Z, a numerical attribute). During the point allocation from a promotion (that is created based on this behavioral event), if the delay strategy is selected as \"Based on the event attribute\", then there will be a drop-down where the attribute should be selected. The following are vital points:\nIn the drop-down of \"delay strategy\", only the date type of the attribute of the behavioral event will appear.\nUnder the prorate drop-down, only the double-type attributes of the behavioral event will appear.\nIf the date coming is a past date as per the event processing date, the conversion will happen on the same day.\nThis option will be available only for promotions based on behavioral events.\nFollowing are the accrual strategies available for transaction-based activities:\nFollowing are the accrual strategies available for behavioral event-based activities:\nZero earn condition\nIn the Zero-earn condition, points are not allocated in the following cases:\nBill Number Prefix:\nWhen the bill number starts with a prefix defined in the\nIGNORE_POINTS_FOR_BILL_NUMBER_STARTS_WITH\nconfiguration.\nCustomer Label:\nWhen the\nBLOCK_POINTS_ALLOCATION\nlabel is set for a customer. You can configure this from\nOrganisation settings > Miscellaneous > Customer Status Configuration\n.\n📘\nNote\nIn these cases, the customer tier will be upgraded if eligible, despite no points being allocated.\nConfigure communication channel(s)\nMandatory channels\nHere you can select the channels through which the communication has to be sent out for sure. Then, configure the message for each channel you select.\nPriority channels\nHere, you can set the channels through which the communication needs to be sent out based on the priority and availability. For example, if you set the priority in the order SMS, email, and mobile push, the system will first check if the customer's mobile number is available,\nIf available, it will send an SMS communication and ignore the rest.\nIf not available, it will check whether the customer has an email ID\nIf an email ID is available, it sends out an email notification to the customer.\nIf not, it will check if the customer is active through mobile push and process the message accordingly.\nOnce the priority channels are set, configure the message for each channel.\nFor more information on communication channels, see here.\nUpgrade tier\nYou can upgrade the tier for the customer based on a tracker value or any specific event value and provide all the privileges of the tier.\nTo configure the\nUpgrade to tier\naction, follow these steps.\nSelect\nUpgrade to tier\nand click *\nSave\n.\nAfter you select\nUpgrade to tier\n, you will see the following screen.\nHover to\nSlab to upgrade\nand choose the desired option from the drop-down.\nToggle\nAward points\nto green to enable the criteria to award the points to the customer.\nIn the\nEarn condition\n, choose the desired condition from the drop-down list.\nTo create a new condition, click on\n+ Add Condition\n.\nSelect the\nExpiry condition\nfrom the drop-down menu.\nTo create a new expiry earn condition from scratch, click\n+ Add condition\n.\nIn\nProrate on\n, choose on what basis you want to issue a percentage of points - transaction amount or event value. This is applicable only for prorated points allocation. If bill amount, choose a current event, if tracker, choose current aggregate or previous aggregate.\nEvent default value\n: Choose this to allocate prorated points on the transaction amount.\nCurrent aggregate\n: Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker post the current transaction.\nPrevious aggregate\n: Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker before the current transaction.\nSelect the channels through which the communication has to be sent out for sure.\ni.\nMandatory channels\n: You can select the channels through which the communication has to be sent out for sure. Then, configure the message for each channel you select.\nii.\nPriority channels\n: Here, you can set the channels through which the communication needs to be sent out based on the priority and availability. For example, if you set the priority in the order SMS, email, and mobile push, the system will first check if the customer's mobile number is available,\nIf available, it will send an SMS communication and ignore the rest.\nIf not available, it will check whether the customer has an email ID\nIf an email ID is available, it sends out an email notification to the customer.\nIf not, it will check if the customer is active through mobile push and process the message accordingly.\nClick on\nSave\n.\nUpgrade using tier\nYou can upgrade customers using the tier conditions when they satisfy a certain condition. It could be regarding the rewards they earned or just a general notification.\nTo configure the Upgrade using tier action, follow these steps:\nIn Action, select\nUpgrade using tier\n.\nIn\nUser entity\n, choose Individual to issue points to customers who met the condition.\nOR\nChoose Group to issue points to the group (Deprecated).\nTo issue points, enable Award points.\nIn the\nEarn condition\n, choose the earning condition that you want to associate using the drop-down list.\nTo create a new condition, click on\n+ Add Condition\n.\nIn\nExpiry condition\n, choose the expiry for the points using the drop-down list.\nTo create a new expiry earn condition, click\n+ Add condition\n.\nIn\nProrate on\n, choose on what basis you want to issue percentage of points - transaction amount or event value. This is applicable only for prorated points allocation. For bill amount, you can choose the\nCurrent event\n, for tracker, you can choose\nCurrent aggregate\nor\nPrevious aggregate\n.\nEvent default value\n: Choose this to allocate prorated points on the transaction amount.\nCurrent aggregate\n: Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker post the current transaction.\nPrevious aggregate\n: Choose this to allocate prorated points on the value of the tracker before the current transaction.\nIssue Coupon\nThis action allows you to issue coupons based on a specific activity.\nIssue Coupon using Quantity\nThe coupons used here are the ones which are claimed by loyalty in strategies.\n📘\nNOTE:\nAll quantity values, whether initially provided as integers or decimals, will always be converted to integers. Decimal values will be rounded accordingly. For example, 4.7 will be rounded to 5, while 3.2 will be rounded to 3.\nCoupon issue types\n1. Fixed Quantity:\nFixed quantity lets you allocate a predetermined number of coupons either uniformly across all tiers or uniquely for each tier.\nSame for all tiers:\nSet a single, fixed quantity of coupons to be issued across all tiers.\nFor example, if you allocate 10 coupons, each customer, regardless of tier, receives 10 coupons for completing an action.\nDifferent for each tier:\nSet a different quantity of coupons for each tier.\nFor example, Tier 1 customers are issued 20 coupons, Tier 2 are issued 30 coupons, and Tier 3 are issued 50 coupons for completing an action.\n2. Transaction Step Function\nThe transaction step function dynamically allocates coupons based on transaction amounts, either uniformly across all tiers or uniquely for each tier.\n📘\nNote:\nThe Transaction Step Function is triggered only when a\nTransactional Event\nis performed by the customer. For all other events Fixed Quantity is supported.\nSame for All Tiers:\nSet a specific transaction amount and fixed quantity of coupons to issue across all tiers.\nFor example, for every transaction worth ₹1000, each customer, regardless of their tier, will be issued 10 coupons for completing the transaction.\nDifferent for Each Tier:\nSet a specific transaction amount and different quantity of coupons for each tier.\nFor example, for every transaction worth ₹1000, Tier 1 customers receive 20 coupons, Tier 2 receive 30 coupons, and Tier 3 receive 50 coupons for completing the transaction.\n❗️\nThe maximum number of coupon that can be allocated to the customer is\n500\n.\nIssue Catalog Reward\nYou can use the\nIssue Catalog Reward\noption to reward customers for specific events. For example, you can issue rewards to customers who register for your loyalty program or, in a health and fitness app, to those who burn 500 kilocalories in a day.\nOnce you create a reward in\nMarvel Reward UI\n, you can issue it based on different events. Rewards can be triggered by:\nPromotions\n: Customers automatically receive rewards when they join promotional campaigns.\nMilestones\n: Rewards are issued when customers reach specific milestones, like spending a certain amount or completing a set number of purchases.\nEvents\n: Customers earn rewards by initiating transaction, customer, or measurable\nbehavioral events\n(with the datatype integer or double).\nYou can issue rewards through\nIssue Catalog Reward\nusing the following:\nFor milestones, streaks, and behavioural events, use Loyalty Promotions flow.\nFor other events, use Loyalty Program workflows.\nFollow these steps to issue a catalog reward:\nFrom the\nAdd Action\nwindow, click on\nIssue Catalog Reward\n.\nClick\nSave\n.\nThe\nAdd action: Issue catalog reward\nwindow opens.\nA note appears in the window stating:\nThe behavior of the “Issue Catalog Rewards” action differs when configured in the “Point to Reward Conversion” customer event compared to other events.\nThis means the behaviour of\nIssue Catalog Rewards\ndiffers between the\n[Point to Reward Conversion](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/auto-points-conversion-to-reward)\nand other events such as the\nCustomer Registration\nTransaction Add\n,\nPoints Redemption\netc.\nThe table below shows the difference in the behaviour of\nIssue Catalog Rewards\naction for\nCustomer Registration\nand\nPoint to Reward Conversion\nevents.\nAspect\nCustomer Registration\nPoint to Reward Conversion\nReward Quantity\nQuantity is defined manually or based on the event.\nQuantity is automatically calculated based on the points earned in the event.\nReward Calculation\nYou define how many rewards to issue. Example: 1 reward for registration\nThe system calculates the reward quantity by dividing the total points by the reward value.\nPoints Requirement\nPoints may or may not be required for issuing the reward.\nPoints are required, and rewards are issued based on accumulated points.\nExample: 1,000 points = 10 rewards if each reward is worth 100 points.\nFlexibility\nYou can control the number of rewards issued manually.\nThe system automatically adjusts the number of rewards based on points earned.\nChoose the Reward you want to issue from the dropdown.\nThe active catalog rewards with Live and Upcoming statuses appear here.\nChoose one of the following from the\nReward quantity same as\ndropdown:\na.\nAdd Manually\ni. Select\nAdd Manually\nto specify the number of rewards you want to issue to a customer.\nii. In\nAdd manually\nfield, enter the number of rewards.\nb.\nTransaction Extended Field\ni. Select\nTransaction Extended Field\nto set the number of rewards a customer receives based on the value captured by the\ntransaction extended field\n.\nii. Select the transaction attribute or value that determines the reward quantity using the\nSelect transaction extended field\ndrop-down.\nFor example, if the transaction extended field\nGross Weight\nvalue is 50, the system issues 50 rewards.\nc.\nPoints Issued on Event\ni. Select\nPoints Issued on Event\nto give rewards based on the points a customer earns during an event.\nFor example, if a customer earns 10 points during an event, they get 10 rewards. The system uses the points earned to decide the number of rewards.\n(Optional) Choose the\nFulfilment status\nfrom the drop-down. Fulfilment status allows you to track and assign a specific status to a reward when it is given to a customer. By setting a fulfilment status, you can let the customer know the reward status whether it is\nbeen shipped\n,\nis on the way\n, or\nbeing processed\n.\n(Optional) Add additional information about the issuance of the reward under\nNotes\n.  This information is shared with the vendor responsible for fulfilling the reward.\nClick on\n+Reward transaction custom fields\n. A list of custom fields available for the organisation is displayed. These are the customer fields created for the Reward (\nusing scope ISSUE_REWARD when using API)\nand allow you to send extra information, such as customer details or specific requirements when issuing a catalog reward. This feature is useful when passing data to a vendor who will fulfil the reward.\nSelect the required custom fields by checking the box or use the\nSearch\noption to find it, then click\nSelect\n. The selected custom fields are displayed.\nChoose a\nMapping type\nfrom the drop down.\na.\nAdd Manually\n- Select\nAdd Manually\nto manually add extra information against a reward transaction custom field. The information can be added against the\nMapped entity\nfield. For example, if you want to add information to the vendor to Issue the reward after 10 days, you can select an appropriate custom field and manually add this message.\nb.\nTransaction Extended Field\n- This mapping type sends information to the vendor through a transaction extended field. For example, if you want to share the GST number of a transaction with the vendor, you can select the appropriate custom field and map it to the GST number transaction extended field. The system resolves the transaction extended field information against the customer in the backend. To use this, select\nReward Transaction Custom Field\nand choose the relevant transaction extended field from the\nMapped Entity\ndrop-down.\nc.\nCustomer Extended Field\n: This mapping type is used to share information with the vendor through a customer extended field. For example, if you want to provide the customer’s communication address to the vendor for sending the reward, you can select the appropriate custom field and map it to the address customer extended field. The system resolves the customer extended field information against the customer in the backend. To use this, select\nReward Transaction Field\nand, from the\nMapped Entity\ndrop-down, choose the relevant customer extended field\nNote\n: You can add, edit, and delete the\nReward transaction custom fields\n.\nClick\nDone\nto issue the reward.\nNote\n: The UI currently does not display the source of coupon issuance, and you cannot filter rewards by fulfilment status. However, you can retrieve the fulfilment status using the\nGet Purchased Rewards for User\nAPI.\nCustomer status & label\nThis action lets you configure the \"customer status & label\" for your customers directly from the workflows. This action will be available in both the loyalty programs & loyalty promotions.\nFor example:\nIf you want to change the \"label\" of all the customers who made transactions worth more than 10,000 as \"high-value\", it can be done with this action directly from workflows.\nIf you want to change the \"label\" of all the customers who made more than 5 returns to \"suspecting\", it can be simply done with this action.\nTo use this action, do the following steps. Go to workflow -> action, and there you'll find:\nAn action \"change customer status & label\"\nNow select the status & label you want to configure. Note that, the label is unique across status. This means that, when you are selecting the label, you are selecting the status also.\nYou'll find that configured action in the display once it is done.\nIn this way, you can change the status & label of your customers directly from workflows.\nUpdated\n2 months ago\nTable of Contents\nAward Points to Referee\nEarn condition\nExpiry condition\nConfigure communication channel(s)\nMandatory channels\nPriority channels\nAward Points to Referrer\nEarn condition\nExpiry condition\nConfigure communication channel(s)\nForward to Set\nEvaluate rules at the line-item level (Enable line-item unrolling)\nEvaluate payment modes (Enable payment method unrolling)\nEvaluate multiple conditions (at the event level)\nEvaluate rules at the line-item level (Enable line-item unrolling)\nEvaluate payment modes (Enable payment method unrolling)\nEvaluate multiple conditions (at the event level)\nRenew Tier\nSend mail\nSend messages\nSend mobile push\nSend SMS\nSend Wechat\nTag Customer\nTransaction point allocation & Allocate Points action\nZero earn condition\nConfigure communication channel(s)\nMandatory channels\nPriority channels\nUpgrade tier\nUpgrade using tier\nIssue Coupon\nCoupon issue types\nIssue Catalog Reward\nCustomer status & label"

Rules are written using a standard “Expression Editor” which works with a pseudo-code format that allows powerful combinations of conditions. Rules engine has a large library of supported conditions and expressions out of the box for a wide range of use cases. RTIM and rules engine are used across various products and modules e.g. Loyalty+, Loyalty Promotions, Cart Promotions, Target Loyalty.\nAnatomy of a rule\nA rule consists of a profile, attribute, operator, and value.\nProfiles in rules\ncurrentCustomer (Customer Profile) - Allows you to write conditions based on the properties of the customer who is currently performing the activity\ncurrentTxn (Transaction Profile) - In Transaction related events this profile allows you to write conditions based on the properties of the transaction (e.g. net amount, category of items present in the txn, etc.)\ncurrentLineItem (Line Item Profile) - In Transaction related events this profile allows you to specify conditions relating to properties of individual items (note: This only works with line item unrolling)\ntenderProfile (Payment Method Profile) - In Txn related events this profile allows you to specify conditions relating to individual payment methods used (note: This only works with payment method unrolling)\ncurrentEvent (The “Event” Profile) - This is a dynamic profile that allows you to write conditions pertaining to that particular customer activity. Its properties are different across the different customer activities\ncurrentTrackerCondition (Tracker Profile) - Inside the Tracker set, this profile allows you to write conditions based on the properties of that particular tracker case\nTo read in detail about profiles and attributes\nclick here\nCompleting a valid expression\nAn expression is considered valid as long as it resolves into a true or a false condition. This can be achieved, by as simple a condition as simply ”true”. Or by completing the appropriate operator and value for the data type. Or even by combining multiple attributes of similar data types together.\nData Types in Expression Editor\nNumbers - These can be integer or double (i.e. decimal values), for example, avgBasketSize, grossAmount, rate, etc.\nString - These are a string of alphanumeric charactersfor example, firstname, email, notes, etc.\nDate - These are date and time values, for example, joinDate, slabExpiryDate, etc.\nBoolean - These are true/false values and won’t need further operators, for example, isControl, isUserGroupInfoPresent, etc.\nNumerical operations\nThe basic range of supported operations on numbers allow us to resolve the number to a boolean outcome through comparison with another value, and these include:\nequal to (=)\nnot equal to (!=)\ngreater than (>)\ngreater than or equal to (>=)\nlesser than (<)\nlesser than or equal to (<=)\nOutside of these, users can also perform mathematical operations to transform the value of the numerical attribute, the supported operations for transformation are:\nAddition (+)\nSubtraction (-)\nMultiplication (*)\nDivision (/)\nMod operation - this provides the remainder after division (%)\nString operations\nThe basic range of string operations serve to resolve the string attribute into a boolean outcome.\nThese operators are inserted after the string attribute using the . notation e.g. currentCustomer.email.contains(\".com\")\nThe following are the string operators:\nContains - used to see if the string contains the defined value\nMatches - this is used to perform regular expression based matching on the string\nisValidDate - used to check if the string is a proper date field\nExists - Some proper value exists for this string (i.e. source passed a value that was not an empty string)\nnotExists - The string is either Null or Empty\nisEmpty - Similar to notExists\nisNull - checks if the string is Null i.e. it was not passed from the source.\nisNotNull - checks if the the string is NOT Null i.e. some value was passed from the source (even an empty string counts)\nA regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for. A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.\nYou can use Regular Expressions for all string attributes using the .matches operator\nThere are also some attributes that support regular expressions as part of its arguments, e.g. currentTxn.basketIncludesRegexCategory(\".SW\")\nSome common useful expressions include:\n. - allows you to match with any character e.g. .SW matches with CSW, VSW, eSW, etc.\n[] - allows you to match from a set of characters e.g. [CV]SW matches with CSW or VSW\n| - acts like an or and allows you to search for different possibilities within the same attribute e.g. currentTxn.basketIncludesRegexCategory(\"shoes|sneakers\")\n^ - matches characters at the start of the entire string e.g. currentTxn.basketIncludesRegexCategory(\"^[Pp]remium\")\n$ - matches characters at the end of the entire string e.g. currentTxn.basketIncludesRegexCategory(\"[Ff]uel$\")\n\\w \\s \\d - allows you to see if there’s any alphabet, any space or any digit/number respectively e.g. currentCustomer.firstname.matches(\"\\s\")\nDate operations\nThe basic range of date operations serves to resolve the date attribute into a boolean outcome. You will commonly be combining multiple attributes in date operations since you will be comparing dates\nisValid - simply checks if a valid date is present in that field e.g. currentCustomer.joinDate.isValid( )\ndateDiff - absolute difference between 2 dates e.g. currentCustomer.joinDate.dateDiff(currentTxn.date)==0\ndaysDiff - same as dateDiff, but ignores the year. Useful for anniversary type promotions e.g. currentCustomer.extField_dob_date.daysDiff(currentTxn.date)==0\ndaysDiffFromString - same as daysDiff, but when you want to use an attribute that could be saved as a string\nminutesDiff - absolute difference similar to dateDiff, but looks at minutes\nday - day of the week, week starts on Sunday as 1 e.g. Terrific Tuesdays would be currentTxn.date.day( )==3\ndayOfMonth - date of the month e.g. For offers on the first 5 days of each month currentTxn.date.dayOfMonth( )<=5\nmonth - month number is returned e.g. currentCustomer.extField_dob_date.month( )==currentTxn.date.month( )\nyear - returns the year from the date e.g. currentCustomer.extField_dob_date.year( )>=1981&¤tCustomer.extField_dob_date.year( )<=1996\nisAfter - checks if the attribute occurs after a defined date-time e.g. currentTxn.date.isAfter(YYYY,MM,DD,HH,MM,SS)\nisHourBetween - scenarios like happy hours. hour in 24 hour format e.g. currentTxn.date.isHourBetween(HH,HH)\nisTimeBetween - similar to happy hours, but when minutes also matter e.g. currentTxn.date.isTimeBetween(HH,MM,HH,MM)\nisWeekday - checks if the date is a weekday e.g. currentTxn.date.isWeekday( )\nisWeekend - checks if the date is a weekend e.g. currentTxn.date.isWeekend( )\nisNull - checks if the the date is Null i.e. it was not passed from source\nisNotNull - checks if the the date is NOT Null i.e. some value was passed from source\nAdding multiple expressions and using brackets\nYou can chain together multiple valid expressions using AND (&&) or an OR (||) condition between them\nYou can use brackets to combine various parts of the expression to control the order in which the expression is checked, particularly to combine AND and OR type expressions as per the use case\ne.g. to check if a customer has either bought for $100 or more in a completely non-discounted transaction, or for $300 or more then you can say ((currentTxn.value>=100)&&(currentTxn.basketSumIf(\"DISCOUNT\",\"NOT_EQUAL_TO\",\"0\")==0))||(currentTxn.value>=300)\nSome tips for efficient rule writing and handling common issues\nUse scope early on and wherever possible to restrict the events being processed by conditions unnecessarily\nReduce redundancies in rule writing through efficient use of the forward to set action - this action is not just for unrolling, it provides an efficient of setting up “global filters”\nE.g. if you have a program construct where only certain concepts qualify for “earning” and only customers in tier ‘Silver’ and above can earn points, create these as scope and conditions in Set 1 itself and forward from there for all other conditions and actions\nUse regular expressions to reduce the need for multiple OR conditions and repeating the same expression\nEnsure expressions match the unrolling status of the ruleset and ensure that the rulesets don’t have nested unrolling actions inside\nCheck for mathematical operations that might lead to irrational numbers e.g. dividing by zero\nString matches can be case sensitive, and might fail because of input errors, as far as possible use the system suggested values or use regular expressions to adjust for those kinds of situations if needed\nUsing combinations of expressions with ==true or ==false along with the “when expression is false” to specify the action can get confusing, so try to avoid double negatives\nSample Scenarios\nIncentivizing on High Spending Customers\nIssuing Coupons for current transaction amounts exceeding a certain value\nConsider that you want to issue coupons for customers whose current transaction amount is greater than 5000, then use the following condition:\ncurrentTxn.value>5000\nFor transaction amounts equal to a certain value, use currentTxn.value==5000\nIssuing Coupons for the current transaction amount between two defined values\nConsider that you want to issue coupons for customers whose current transaction amount is greater than 1000, but less than 5000, then use the following condition:\ncurrentTxn.value>1000&&(currentTxn.value<5000)\nTo learn more about current Transaction profile, and value profile\nclick here\nIncentivizing on Customer Name and Transaction Amount\nSuppose that your store founder’s name is “John Smith” and you want to issue coupons to customers whose name matches that of the founder.

This ensures that points are issued only until the set threshold is reached.\nTypes of Limits\nThere are two types of limits for which points can be capped.\nIndividual transaction limits\n: These limits are applied at each transactional level. For each successful transaction, points are issued based on the conditions set. You can create a maximum of ten individual transaction limits for a loyalty program.\nExample:\nA retailer limits loyalty points to a maximum of  300 points per transaction. If a customer makes a purchase of ₹1000 and could earn 1000 points, they will only receive 300 points due to the limit. This helps the retailer manage their points.\nIndividual Customer Limits:\nThese limits are set at the customer level. When choosing this limit type, you can specify both the 'duration of the limit' and the 'audience type' to which it will apply—options include all customers, specific customers, or customers enrolled via API.\nYou can create up to ten limits for the \"all customers\" audience type and a maximum of 50 limits for other audience types. However, the total number of limits across all audience types cannot exceed 50. For instance, if you define ten limits for the \"all customers\" audience, you can only create 40 limits for specific customers and those enrolled via API combined.\nCreating a Points / Alternate Currency Allocation Limit\nTo create a points / alternate currency allocation limit, follow these steps:\nNavigate to a loyalty program and select\nEdit Program\n.\nSelect\nAdvanced settings\nand navigate to the\nPoints Allocation Limits\nsection.\nSelect\n+Add Limit\nto open the\nAdd points allocation limit\nwindow.\nEnter the required details and define the KPI and limit values.\nThe fields are as follows:\nField\nDescription\nName\nA unique name for the allocation limit.\nLimit on\nThe entity type on which the limit will be set. Refer to the section for more information on\ntypes of limits\n.\nReward currency\nThe reward currency to apply capping. Capping can be applied on\npoints\nor\nalternate currencies\n. The available alternate currencies for the organisation are listed in the drop down.\nCurrency limit based on\nThe KPI on which the limit will be set. Refer to the section for more information on\ntypes of KPIs\n.\nLimit value\nThe maximum number of reward currency (points or alternate currency) that can be awarded to the customer.\nScope\nApply capping based on a specific scope.\nThe scopes are as follows:\n- All transactions: Apply capping for all transactions.\n-\nBrands\n: Apply capping for a brand in the organisation.\n-\nCategories\n: Apply capping for a category in the organisation.\n-\nCustom attributes\n: Apply capping for a product attribute in the organisation.\n-\nSKU\n: Apply capping on a list of SKUs. You can upload a .csv file containing the list of SKUs.\n-\nStore\n: Apply capping for a store in the organisation.\n-\nZone\n: Apply capping for a zone in the organisation.\nNotes:\n- Brands, categories, custom attributes, SKU, store and zone can be filtered only for the Line-item amount and Line-item quantity KPIs.\n- The default option is\nAll transactions\n.\nExclude Promotions\nExclude any active or upcoming promotions from the limit.\nActivity\n(Applicable for individual customer limits)\nThe customer activity on which the limit is set. You can set activities for the following types:\nAll Activities:\nThe limit is active for all\ncustomer activities\n. Points earned by the user from any activity (transaction, behavioural events) will be tracked under the capping.\nTransaction Add:\nThe limit is active only for transaction related activities.\nAudience\n(Applicable for individual customer limits)\nWhen setting the limit, you can choose from the following customer segments:\nAll Customers:\nIncludes every loyalty customer in the program.\nSpecific Customers:\nCapping only for the customers defined in the selected audience group. Refer to the documentation for more information on\naudience groups\n.\nEnrol via API:\nIncorporates customers enrolled in the capping through the\nEnrol/Re-enrol a customer to a milestone/streak API\n.\nRefreshes every\n(Applicable for individual customer limits)\nThe time period for refreshing the limit. When the limit is refreshed, the customer can begin earning reward currencies till the limit is reached.\nThe supported options are daily, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, and yearly.\n1st cycle starts on\n(Applicable for individual customer limits)\nThe start date of the 1st cycle or the date from which capping is enabled for the customer.\nTotal number of cycles\n(Applicable for individual customer limits)\nThe total number of times the limit is refreshed. Currently, the maximum number of cycles supported is 10.\nSelect Done to save the changes.\nTypes of KPIs\nThere are five types of KPIs available through which points can be limited.\nReward Currencies\nThis is how the brands can directly apply capping on points or alternate currencies. There are three types of cappings for which limits can be applied:\nRegular: Loyalty points or alternate currencies issued to customers. These are the points from the programs.\nPromotional: Bonus points or alternate currencies that are awarded to the customer irrespective of any transaction. These are from the loyalty promotions.\nRegular + Promotional: A combination of regular and promotional points or alternate currencies.\nExample:\nA brand wants to issue a maximum of 1000 regular points on each transaction done by a customer.\nLine-item amount\nThis is an indirect way to control the points given to the customer using line-item amount. A line item refers to the individual products or services that a brand offers. Benefits can be capped based on transactions for that category of line items.\nExample:\nA brand wants to issue benefits for\nbeverage transactions\nof up to ₹1000. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions on beverages that are above this limit.\nLine-item quantity\nThis is an indirect way to control the points given to the customer using line-item quantity. A line item refers to the individual products or services offered by a brand. Benefits can be capped based on the quantity for that category of line items.\nExample:\nA brand wants to issue benefits for\nfuel transactions\nof up to ten liters. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions on fuel that are above this limit.\nTransaction Amount\nBenefits can be capped based on the transaction amount.\nExample:\nA brand wants to issue benefits up to a total transaction amount of ₹1000. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions that are above this limit.\nTransaction Count\nBenefits can be capped based on the number of transactions done by a customer.\nExample:\nA brand wants to issue benefits for up to\nfive transactions\ndone by a customer. No additional benefits will be issued for transactions that are above this limit. This limit will be refreshed based on the defined period for the customer.\n📘\nNotes:\nBoth line-item amount & line-item quantity type of capping cannot be used together. For example, if a capping is created based on line-item amount (in either the individual transaction capping or individual customer capping), then the line-item quantity capping cannot be used.\nThe transaction count limit is applicable only for individual customer limits.\nCapping in Multi-Loyalty Programs\nOrganizations with multiple loyalty programs may have a default program and several loyalty programs configured. When a customer makes a purchase, the transaction is processed through the source program first, followed by the default program. Capping is processed in the same order. Capping rules for the source program are checked before those for the default program.\nExample\n: A loyalty program allows\n300 points\nwhile the default program allows\n200 points\nper transaction. If a customer makes a transaction, they will get\n300 points from the loyalty program\nand only\n200 points from the default program.\nTransaction Amount Capping in Tracker Sets and Points Trackers\nTransaction Amount-Based Capping\n: While transaction amount-based capping limits (e.g., limiting the points awarded based on a transaction cap of $500) apply across most rule sets,\nthey are typically not enforced within tracker sets or points trackers\n. This means that in tracker evaluations, the full transaction amount is considered for points calculation, even if it exceeds a predefined cap.\nHowever, cappings related to\ntransaction count\nand\npoints allocation\ndo apply universally across all rule sets, including tracker sets and points trackers. This ensures that overall program limits, like the total number of transactions or maximum points awarded, remain consistent and are adhered to across all rule evaluations.\nExample Scenario\nCapping Configuration\n:\nTransaction Amount Cap\n: Points should only be allocated on a maximum of $500 per transaction.\nTransaction Count Cap\n: Maximum of 3 transactions allowed within a rolling 30-day period.\nPoints Cap\n: Customers can earn up to 5,000 points per transaction.\nCustomer Transactions\n:\nTransaction 1\n: Customer spends $800 on 1st September.\nPoints Earned\n: Based on the transaction cap, points should only be calculated on $500, resulting in:\n$500 * 50% =\n250 points\n.\nTransaction 2\n: Customer spends $1,200 on 10th September.\nPoints Earned\n: Capped at $500, so points = $500 * 50% =\n250 points\n.\nTransaction 3\n: Customer spends $700 on 20th September.\nPoints Earned\n: Capped at $500, so points = $500 * 50% =\n250 points\n.\nTracker Set Evaluation\nSuppose a points tracker is configured to evaluate these transactions:\nTracker Action\n: The tracker evaluates each transaction amount and applies actions based on it (e.g., tier progression or issuing a reward).\nIn the tracker set:\nTransaction 1\n: Points awarded based on full $800 (ignoring the transaction amount cap) resulting in 800 * 50% =\n400 points\n.\nTransaction 2\n: Points awarded based on full $1,200, resulting in 1,200 * 50% =\n600 points\n.\nTransaction 3\n: Points awarded based on full $700, resulting in 700 * 50% =\n350 points\n.\nFrequently asked questions\nCan I add quantity and amount limits together?\nNo, line-item amount and line-item quantity capping cannot be applied together. This is because the line-item amount and line-item quantity both refer to the same information on a transaction. Calculating them differently on the same item can cause ambiguity and computational challenges while applying capping.\nHow does it work with set-level capping?\nBrands can use set-level capping for cases not possible with this advanced capping. The idea of this advanced capping is to reduce the heavy dependency on set-level capping so that the overall use experience increases & the computational speed of the workflow increases.\nIf have regular and promotional points what is applied first? So that users know what will be capped?\nThe hierarchy is: regular points, then promotional points. Regular points capping is validated first, followed by promotional points capping.\nWill I be able to see this data in member care?\nCurrently, there is no member care view for capping.\nWill I see cappings applied in evaluation logs?\nYes, capping details of transactions will be available in evaluation logs. The Sustenance team can view these details for debugging purposes.\nCan I pause cappings?\nCurrently, there is no way to pause a capping. Users can configure and delete a capping as needed.\nHow do I exclude certain promotions from capping limits?\nThe “Exclude Promotions” option lets you configure capping so that any included promotion will be excluded.\nTip: To apply capping to only one promotion, select all promotions in \"Excluded promotions\" and then deselect that specific promotion.\nCan the total number of capping for each type be increased.\nYou can create a maximum of\nten\nindividual transaction limits and a maximum of\n50\nindividual customer limits (across all three audience types) for a loyalty program.\nUpdated\n3 months ago\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nTypes of Limits\nCreating a Points / Alternate Currency Allocation Limit\nTypes of KPIs\nCapping in Multi-Loyalty Programs\nTransaction Amount Capping in Tracker Sets and Points Trackers\nFrequently asked questions"

It typically takes the shape of a hierarchy, with each tier providing progressively more advantages (or more valuable benefits).\nExample: Here customers are divided into various slabs/tiers based on loyalty events or purchases made by them and the slabs are called Member, silver, Gold anthe d Platinum. The rewards in terms of points increase with the increase in Slab of the customer.\nString and numerical Operators\nThe basic range of string operations serve to resolve the string attribute into a boolean outcome. These operators are inserted after the string attribute using the . notation e.g. currentCustomer.email.contains(\".com\")\nstring operators mainly used for slabName\nContains\n- used to see if the string contains the defined value\nMatches\n- this is used to perform regular expression based matching on the string\nisNull\n- checks if the string is Null i.e. it was not passed from source\nisNotNull\n- checks if the the string is NOT Null i.e. some value was passed from source (even an empty string counts).\nNumerical Operators mainly used for slabNumber.\nEquals to (=)\nUnequals to (!=)\nGreater than (>)\nGreater than or equal to (>=)\nLess than (<)\nLess than or equal to (<=)\nAND (&&)\nOR(||)\nAttributes based on SLAB information.\nAttribute\nSub-Attribute\noperator\nExample\nslabName\nNA\ncontains, matches, ==, isNull, isNotNull\ncurrentCustomer.slabName==\"Gold\"\ninitialSlabName\nNA\ncontains, matches, ==, isNull, isNotNull\ncurrentCustomer.initialSlabName == \"First\"\nslabName\nData Type :\nString\nDescription :\ncustomer’s current tier name.\nSyntax: currentCustomer.slabName[operators][Value]\nExample1: As a brand, we have a tired based loyalty program where the tiers are silver, gold & Platinum. We have separate points allocation strategies for tiers respectively, thus write a condition to allocate points for a customer in Gold Tier.\nProfile -> currentCustomer\nslabName -> GOLD\nRule expression -> currentCustomer.slabName==“Gold”\nExample 2: Write a condition to check if a current Customer Slab is Shine, and currentCustomer points are greater than 1000, If the condition is TRUE. Allocate 500 points and upgrade the tier.\nRule : currentCustomer.slabName==\"Shine\"&&(currentCustomer.currentPoints>1000)\nslabNumber\nData Type :\nInt (Integer)\nDescription:\nCurrent Customer slab number lets say 10, 1, 3 etc\nSyntax: currentCustomer.slabNumber[Operators][SLAB Number]\nExample1: Write a rule to evaluate a condition that a current customer slab number is equal to 3 and current transaction value is greater than and equal to 300 but less than and equal to 600.\nExpression: ((currentCustomer.slabNumber==3)&&(currentTxns.value)>=30&&(currentTxns.value<600))\nExample 2: Write an expression/rule to check if current slabNumber is greater than initialSlabNumber and current slab number is equal to 3.\n((currentCustomer.slabNumber > currentCustomer.initialSlabNumber) && (currentCustomer.slabNumber == 3))\ninitialSlabNumber\nData Type :\nInt (Integer)\nDescription:\nInitial slab number of the Current Customer before evaluating an event, let's say 10, 1, 3 etc\nSyntax: currentCustomer.initialSlabNumber[Operators][SLAB Number]\nExample 1: Write an expression/rule to check if current slabNumber is greater than initialSlabNumber or current slab number is equal to 4.\nAns:  ((currentCustomer.slabNumber > currentCustomer.initialSlabNumber)  || (currentCustomer.slabNumber == 4))\ninitialSlabName\nData Type :\nInt (Integer)\nDescription:\nInitial slab name of the Current Customer before evaluating an event, let's say Basic, Member, silver etc.\nSyntax: currentCustomer.initialSlabNumber[Operators][SLAB Name]\nExample: Write a simple rule to check if the current customer transaction is greater than 500 and the initial slab name was silver.\ncurrentTxn.value>100&&(currentCustomer.slabName.matches(\"SILVER\"))\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nWhat is a slab/Tier ?\nString and numerical Operators\nAttributes based on SLAB information.\nslabName\nslabNumber\ninitialSlabNumber\ninitialSlabName"

Segments are used to tailor the marketing efforts of brands effectively. Segmentation is usually done based on demographics or customer behavior. A segment consists of different values called partitions. For example, we can have a segment name Transaction Value whose partitions could be High, Medium, and Low.\nLet's say you want to group the customers based on adventure sports they like or not:\nCluster Name: Adventure SportsCluster Value: Mountaineering, Trekking, Rock Climbing, Sport Climbing\nClusters or Customer Segments are created in Insights+ Module, To know more about customer segment creation :\nclick here\nCluster Value Includes\nProfile:\nCurrent Customer (currentCustomer)\nreturn data type\n: Boolean\nAttribute Label\n: clusterValueIncludes\nMeaning\n: To check if a customer belongs to a particular cluster (segment).\nSub-Attributes\n: cluster Name and cluster sub segments\nSyntax\n: currentCustomer.clusterValueIncludes(\"cluster name\",\"cluster sub components\")\nExample: A marketing Manager of a corporate gifting company wanted to select the customers from selected companies to send the communication of the latest festival offers.\nCluster name: corporate\nCluster sub-segments name:\nKPMG, Magnus India, Polaris, Time of India, RENAISSANCE, Epicenter Technology, Capillary, \"NESS TECHNOLOGIES\".\nOut of all the values, they want to send communication to the customer belonging to the following sub-segments KPMG, CAPILLARY, TOI\nOR :** ||\nRule:\ncurrentCustomer.clusterValueIncludes(“corporate”,”KPMG”)||currentCustomer.clusterValueIncludes(“corporate”,”TOI”)||currentCustomer.clusterValueIncludes(“corporate”,”capillary”)**\nExample: Write a rule, to check if the customer belongs to the cluster name “lastest_4june” and the customer preferred language is English and currentTxn value is greater than and equal to 250.

For example, you can drive sales through promotion programs by rewarding additional points or coupons to customers during a festival season or promoting a specific product.\nYou can run promotion programs either at a transaction level, line item level, or customer level. Based on the event, the promotion type varies automatically. For example, in customer events, you cannot create transaction promotions and vice versa.\n📘\nYou cannot create promotion programs for all events. For example, you cannot create promotions on events, ReturnTransaction, TransactionUpdate, DelayedAccrual, SlabUpgrade, and all group events (such as GroupTransactionAdd, GroupTransactionUpdate, GroupReturnTransaction, GroupMemberJoin, and GroupMemberLeave).\nYou can create transaction or transaction line-item promotions only for the TransactionAdd event. For all other applicable events, you can create only customer-level promotion programs.\nTo create a promotion program, do the following\nOn the loyalty program configuration page, go to\nWorkflows\nand then go to\nLoyalty Promotions\n.\nOr, you can go over to the\nPromotions tab\non the top right.\nAlready active promotions can be seen in list view or calendar view.\nAnd the existing promotions can also be filtered according to program, activity and status of the promotion.\nIn the calendar view, a grid line can be set up according to the timeline required.\nClick on\nCreate Promotion\n.\nFill in the basic details.\nIn\nPromotion Name\n, specify a name for the promotion.\nIn\nDescription\n, enter a short description of the current promotion.\nSelect Customer Activity that would trigger earning.\nThe following table lists the available customer activities:\nCustomer Activity\nDescription\nExample\nMakes a transaction\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they make a purchase in-store, online, or at a point-of-sale (POS) system.\nA customer purchases a pair of sneakers online or at a store.\nMilestone or Streak is updated\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they complete a\nmilestone\nor\nstreak\n.\nNote:\nBy default, all active milestones and streaks in a\nloyalty program\nis tracked. You can optionally choose active milestones or streaks to track under the\nMilestone or streak\ndrop down.\nA customer achieves a milestone by drinking 50 litres of water in a week.\nA customer achieves a streak by walking 10,000 steps everyday for a week.\nRedeems points\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they use their points to redeem rewards.\nA customer uses 500 points to redeem a ₹500 discount while purchasing groceries\nRedeems a coupon\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they use coupons to get discounts or benefits.\nA customer applies a 20% discount coupon during checkout in an online store.\nGets enroled in the program\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they join a\nloyalty program\n.\nA customer makes a transaction of above ₹10,000 and is enrolled into a loyalty program.\nUpdates customer profile\nEnrol a customer to a promotion when they update their personal information on their profile.\nA customer updates their phone number on the app.\nIn\nPromotion applied on\n, choose\nTransaction\nLevel to award points on a transaction or choose\nLineitem\nlevel to issue points on the transaction line items.\nNote:\nThis field is visible only when you have selected transaction-related customer activity in the previous step.\nSet\nActivate\nto Yes to enable the program.\nSet the duration of the promotion in\nStart Date\nand\nEnd Date\n.\nNOTE\n: Promotion duration can be in the past, up to the last 12 months. Once a promotion has started, the start date cannot be edited; however, you can still change the start date for any promotions that are upcoming.\n📘\nSample Scenario for Exclusive option\nAssume two promotion programs where Promotion2 is set as EXCLUSIVE.\nPromotion1: If the transaction amount is greater than $500, reward points of 10% of the transaction amount\nPromotion2: If the transaction amount is greater than $750, reward points of 15% of the transaction amount.\nNow when a customer makes a transaction for $800, instead of rewarding points for both the promotion programs, only promotion2 will be executed, i.e., 120 points (15% of 800).\nOnce the promotion program is created, configure rulesets for each event as explained in the following.\nNow the promotion workflows need to be configured. In\nAll Conditions\n, click\n+Condition\nto add a new rule. Each condition you dd will have a condition sequence as the prefix. For example, Condition1, Condition2, Condition3, and so on.\n📘\nNote\nf you want to delete any condition, click on the respective Delete icon. The sequence will be updated accordingly.\nYou also have the option to rename the set if you wish to modify its title, providing greater flexibility in organizing and managing your sets more effectively.\nIn the\nExpression\nbox, define the rule expression that you want to evaluate for the current promotion.

To publish promotions and loyalty programs separately, raise a ticket to the sustenance team.\nOnce enabled, this change is permanent and cannot be reverted.\nAdvanced Settings\nPoints Allocation limits\nThese limits or capping let you budget the points that will be allocated via these promotions. This can done in various ways & combinations :\nMaximum number of point activities for a member - Define the max events or customer activities that can allocate points to a customer from the promotion. Eg - This promotion can be applied to a customer maximum 3 times.\nMaximum points to be allocated in a single activity - Define the max points that can be allocated in an event or customer activity. Eg - This promotion can only allocate 100 points in a transaction.\nMaximum points to be allocated to a member - Define the max points that can be allocated to a customer from the promotion.  Eg - A customer can earn only upto 500 points from this promotion .\nMaximum points to be allocated from overall promotion - Define the max points that can be allocated from this promotion. Eg - The promotion can allocate upto 5000 points. This means, once 5000 points have been awarded from this promotion, it will be exhausted.\nLimits when Advance Promotions capabilities are enabled\nWhen Advance Loyalty Promotions feature is enabled, these points allocation limits become more flexible and provides wider variety of limits to be configured.\nThe key differentiator here, are the specific time durations for these limits. You can define these limits apply within :\nPromotion Duration\n- This ideally means, that there is no specific time duration set in this case, because these limits are anyways applicable for the time promotion is active.\na day\n- Setting this means the limit is applicable within a day or 24 hours. This behaves in a moving window format, so whenever the promotion event occurs, from that instance, the system will go back 24 hours/a day and check if the limits is reached. Eg - Allocate 100 points to a customer from a promotion in a day. So in a day, a customer can only get 100 points from this promotion and event if the customer performs multiple events within the 24 hours duration, on every event, the system will go back and check for 24 hours.\nin last 7 days\n- Setting this means the limit is applicable within last 7 days or a week. This behaves in a moving window format, so whenever the promotion event occurs, from that instance, the system will go back 7 days and check if the limits is reached. Please be mindful, it is not a fixed window, where you are defining a week from Monday to Sunday. On every event occurrence , the system will go back 7 days and check for the limit value.\nin last 30 days\n-  Setting this means the limit is applicable within last 30 days or a month. This behaves in a moving window format, so whenever the promotion event occurs, from that instance, the system will go back 30 days and check if the limits is reached. Please be mindful, it is not a fixed window, where you are defining a month from 1st to 30th. On every event occurrence , the system will go back 30 days and check for the limit value.\nLimits :\nIndividual activity limit\nMax. points allocation per occurrence of activity - Define the max points that can be allocated in an event or customer activity. Eg - This promotion can only allocate 100 points in a transaction.\nIndividual customer limit\nMax. points allocation per customer across purchases - Define the max points that can be allocated to a customer from the promotion.  Eg - A customer can earn only upto 500 points from this promotion .\nMax. no. of activities per customer that can allocate points - Define the max events or customer activities that can allocate points to a customer from the promotion. Eg - This promotion can be applied to a customer maximum 3 times.\nAcross customers limit\nMax. points allocation across customers - Define the max points that can be allocated from this promotion. Eg - The promotion can allocate upto 5000 points. This means, once 5000 points have been awarded from this promotion, it will be exhausted.\nMax. no. of activities across customers that can allocate points - Define the max events or customer activities that can allocate points across customers from the promotion. Eg - This promotion allocates to total 500 transactions.\nCreate Forward Cases (to Another Set)\nTo check multiple conditions at a time, use the Forward to Set action as explained in the following.\nAfter writing the\nrule expression\n, and\nExpression equals\n, set the action as\nForward to Set\n.\nClick\nForward to Set\nfrom the list.\nSet\nEnable lineitem unrolling?\nto Yes to create rules based on transaction line items. Set\nEnable payment method unrolling?\nto Yes to create rules on payment modes.\nTo create rules based on line-items in the forward set (set2), set\nEnable lineitem unroller\nto Yes; to create rules based on payment mode in the forward set(set2, set\nEnable payment method unroller\nto Yes.\nFor the lineitem unroller, you will see the\nUse lineitem Proportions?\noption. This option lets you issue points on line items based on the line item amount.\nAssume a transaction with two lineitems, where lineitem1 is $800 and lineitem2 is $1200; bill level discount is $400. Hence, the total bill amount is $1600.\nIf points allocation is set to 10% of the transaction amount, the allocation of points in the case of\nUse Proportions\nis as follows.\nIf\nUse Proportions\nis disabled, points of 10% will be awarded for each line item. That is 80 points for lineitem1 and 120 points for lineitem2.\nIf\nUse Proportions\nis enabled, points will be issued on proportionate of the bill amount. That is, for line item one - 10% of (800/2000)\n1600 and for lineitem2, it will be 10% off (1200/2000)\n1600.\nThe\nMaximise Points Allocation?\noption considers the payment methods marked as eligible under 'Advanced Settings' and allocates points for the total eligible amount when different line items earn at different rate considering the higher earning first rather than a pro-rata basis\nConfigure action and click\nSave\n.

Subsequently, upon meeting the criteria defined in the promotion during their next transaction, the benefits are provided.\nEnrol & Issue (Backend: LOYALTY_EARNING) - This promotion type follows a three-step process:\nEnrollment: Customers are first enrolled in the promotion.\nIssuance: The promotion is then issued to enrolled customers based on specific criteria.\nRedemption of promotion/Earning the benefits: Customers receive benefits upon meeting the requirements outlined in the issued promotion.\n📘\nNote\nBy default, the promotion types Direct issue, and Enrol & Issue are not enabled for all the orgs. These are part of our advanced Loyalty promotions suite. To enable these features, please contact your Customer Success Representative.\nUpdated\n6 months ago"

They are aimed at rewarding customer loyalty and fostering repeat purchases. This is similar to the basic promotion.\nThese promotions are not specifically issued to individual customers instead benefits are directly provided to the customers when they meet the defined criteria. When a customer meets the requirements, the promotion is automatically applied to their transaction, resulting in the issuance of benefits such as loyalty points, tier upgrades, coupons, or badges.\nUse cases\nUse Case 1:\nScenario:\nA marketing manager aims to reward loyal customers with a tier upgrade.\nConfiguration:\nThe manager sets up a promotion with rules specifying that customers who make five or more purchases within a month qualify for a tier upgrade.\nAuto-Application:\nWhen a customer completes their fifth purchase within the designated timeframe, the system automatically applies the promotion to their transaction, elevating their tier status.\nUse Case 2:\nScenario:\nA marketing manager seeks to reward customers with a 10% bonus points offer during the festive season.\nConfiguration:\nThe manager defines a promotion with rules indicating that customers receive a 10% bonus points on each transaction based on the bill amount during the festive period.\nAuto-Application:\nA customer makes a $1000 purchase on various items. Following the configured rules, the customer earns 100 loyalty points for this transaction.\nUse Case 3:\nScenario:\nEncouraging Healthy Lifestyles\nConfiguration:\nA wellness brand endeavors to promote healthy lifestyle choices among its customers. The marketing team creates a promotion offering 50 bonus points for every 10,000 steps walked in a day.\nAutomatic Application: Customers who have opted into health tracking have their daily step count automatically monitored. Upon reaching the milestone of 10,000 steps in a day, the promotion is automatically applied to their account.\nReward Issuance:\nCustomers achieving the step goal receive 50 bonus points credited to their account as a reward.\nCreating \"Available to Issue\" promotion\n🚧\nAttention!\nThe promotion type cannot be changed after creation of a promotion.\nCreating \"Available to Issue\" promotion is similar to creating a basic promotion type except that you must select\nAvailable to Issue\nfrom the\nPromotion type\noption. This option is not available with the basic promotion.\nTo create a  \"Direct Issue\" promotion, perform the following during creation of a promotion\nSelect\nAvailable to Issue\nfrom the\nPromotion type\noption.\nIn the\nCondition\nexpression text box, define the criteria to issue the promotion in the expression language.\nIn the\nAdd action\n, select the benefits that need to be provided upon meeting the criteria.\nUpdated\n12 months ago\nTable of Contents\nUse cases\nUse Case 1:\nUse Case 2:\nUse Case 3:\nCreating \"Available to Issue\" promotion"

Subsequently, upon meeting the criteria defined in the promotion during their next transaction, the benefits are provided.\nThe issuance of promotions occurs through various activity workflows such as TransactionAdd and Behavioral events. From a marketer's perspective, customers receive a promotion, while from the customer's perspective, they earn a promotion.\nUse Case 1\nScenario:\nA marketing manager targets VIP customers with a special discount.\nConfiguration:\nThe promotion offers a 30% discount coupon on the next purchase to VIP customers who make 3 visits to the store in 1 month.\nIssuance:\nOnce a customer achieves VIP status and meets the visit milestone, the promotion is automatically issued to them.\nRedemption:\nVIP customers receive the promotion and can immediately redeem the discount on their next purchase.\nUse Case 2\nScenario:\nA coffee shop rewards frequent visitors with a free beverage.\nConfiguration:\nThe promotion provides a free beverage after every fifth visit to the store.\nIssuance:\nThe system tracks customer visits and identifies those who have visited the store five times within a month.\nRedemption:\nEligible customers receive the promotion via email or SMS and can redeem the free beverage during their next visit.\nUse Case 3\nScenario:\nA health app promotes hydration habits through a challenge.\nConfiguration:\nCustomers opt-in to the \"Hydration Challenge\" mission, which offers incentives such as bonus points and a gift card upon completion.\nIssuance:\nCustomers who join the mission are directly issued the promotion.\nCompletion:\nParticipants track their daily water intake, aiming to drink 8 glasses of water daily for 4 weeks.\nReward Issuance: Customers who successfully complete the challenge receive bonus points and a gift card automatically credited to their account.\nCreating Direct issue promotion\n🚧\nAttention!\nThe promotion type cannot be changed after creation of a promotion.\nTo create a  \"Direct Issue\" promotion, perform the following during the creation of a promotion\nSelect\nDirect issue\nfrom the\nPromotion type\noption.\nIn the\nCondition\nexpression text box, define the criteria to issue the promotion in the expression language.\nSelect\nAdd action\nto define the benefits (badge, coupon etc) that need to be issued to customers on meeting the criteria.\nClick\nPublish promotion\n.\nYou can set the points allocation limit in the\nAdvanced settings\n.\nDefining issual expiry\nIssual expiry refers to the duration within which a customer must complete the specified activity to receive the benefits of the promotion.\nYou can define the expiry for issued promotions under\nIssual expiry\nin the\nAdvanced settings\nof the promotion.\nThere are two types of expiry:\nAlong with promotion\nAfter a specific period from promotion issual\nAlong with promotion\nWhen the issual expiry is set to \"along with promotion,\" it aligns with the promotion end date. For instance, if the promotion end date is April 30th, then customers who receive the promotion on April 1st can avail of its benefits if they complete the earning activity by April 30th. Similarly, customers who receive the promotion on April 3rd can also enjoy its benefits if they complete the earning activity by April 30th. In this scenario, the expiry remains consistent for all customers, regardless of when the promotion was issued.\nAfter specific period from promotion issual\nIn this, the promotion expires after a specified number of days from the time of issual. For instance, if the issual expiry is set to 10 days from promotion issual, then a customer who receives the promotion on April 1st can avail of its benefits by completing the activity until April 11th. Similarly, a customer who receives the promotion on April 3rd can complete the activity until April 13th to enjoy the benefits of the promotion.\n📘\nNotes\nThe expiries are calculated based on the store timezone.\nThese expiries can be updated when the promotion is upcoming, live or ended.\nDefining limits for issuing promotions and redemption\nYou can define the restrictions for the promotion issues and redemption under\nIssual limit\nin the\nAdvanced settings\n.\nMax times a promotion can be issued to a customer (Backend Earn):\nEnter the maximum number of times a promotion can be issued to a customer. The default value is 1.\nMax times one issual can be redeemed\n: Enter the maximum number of times a single issual can be redeemed. The default value is 1.\nBoth issual and redemption limits can have a maximum value of 100.\n📘\nNotes\nOnce the restrictions are completely consumed, further enrollment and issual for a promotion will be unavailable for a particular customer.\nThese limits can be updated while the promotion is in the upcoming, live, or ended state\nIssue loyalty promotion\nThe promotions can be issued through Issue loyalty promotion action in loyalty workflows and loyalty promotions or using API\nVia Issue loyalty promotion action in loyalty workflows and loyalty promotions.\nUpdated\n6 months ago\nTable of Contents\nUse Case 1\nUse Case 2\nUse Case 3\nCreating Direct issue promotion\nDefining issual expiry\nDefining limits for issuing promotions and redemption\nIssue loyalty promotion"

Upon meeting the requirements outlined in the issued promotion, customers earn the associated benefits.\nThese promotions typically involve a three-step process: initial enrolment, followed by completing a specific action to earn the promotion, and finally receiving the benefits of that promotion. They aim to engage customers through a more interactive and participatory approach.\nMarketing managers enrol customers in these promotions, limiting the promotion earnings to a targeted audience. Once enrolled, customers can perform the specified actions to earn the promotion.\nIn the backend, Enrol is Issue and Issue is Earn. From a marketer’s perspective, a customer is enrolled in a promotion, and the customer is issued a promotion. However, from the customer’s perspective, they receive a promotion and then earn its benefits.\nUse Case 1\nScenario:\nA marketing manager initiates a referral program to incentivize customers to refer friends to the platform. Upon referring their friends, customers will earn a promotion granting them 2000 bonus points and the Referral Champion badge upon their 3rd successful referral.\nEnrolment:\nCustomers who have made at least three purchases in the past 6 months are enrolled in the referral program.\nCustomer Action:\nEnrolled customers receive a unique referral link and are prompted to share it with friends.\nIssuance: When a referred friend makes their first purchase using the unique link, the referring customer earns the promotion. Upon three successful referrals, resulting in their friends' first purchases, the referring customer receives the benefits of the promotion, including 2000 bonus points and the Referral Champion badge.\nUse Case 2\nScenario:\nEnhancing Engagement Through Product Reviews\nEnrolment:\nA fashion retailer aims to boost customer engagement by encouraging them to write product reviews. Customers who have made a purchase within the last month are enrolled in the review program.\nCustomer Action:\nEnrolled customers receive an email inviting them to write a review for their purchased product. Incentivized with a promotion offering 500 bonus points and a 10% discount coupon for their next purchase, customers are encouraged to provide feedback.\nIssuance: Upon submitting a review, customers are issued a promotion entitling them to 500 bonus points and a 10% discount coupon for their next purchase. Subsequently, when making their next purchase, customers receive 500 bonus points and a 10% discount on all products.\nUse Case 3\nScenario:\nDiabetes Wellness Challenge\nTargeted Enrolment:\nCustomers with diabetes are automatically enrolled in the \"Sugar-Free Challenge\" upon joining the wellness platform. Enrolled customers receive the \"Sugar-Free Challenge\" promotion, encouraging them to abstain from added sugars for one week.\nCommitment and Tracking:\nCustomers opt into the challenge, committing to avoiding added sugars daily for one week. Upon opting in, the promotion is issued to them.\nAchievement and Reward:\nUpon successfully completing the challenge, customers are rewarded with 100 bonus points as recognition of their commitment.\nCreating Enrol & Issue type of promotion\n🚧\nAttention!\nThe promotion type cannot be changed after creation of a promotion.\nTo create an \"Enrol & Issue\" promotion, perform the following during the creation of a promotion\nSelect\nEnrol & issue\nfrom the\nPromotion type\noption.\nIn the\nCondition\nexpression text box, define the criteria to issue the promotion in the expression language.\nSelect\nAdd action\nto define the benefits (badge, coupon etc) that need to be issued to customers on meeting the criteria.\nClick\nPublish promotion\n.\nYou can set the points allocation limit in the\nAdvanced settings\n.\nDefining enrolment expiry\nThis is the duration within which a customer must complete the issuance activity for the promotion.\nThere are two types of expiry:\nAlong with promotion\nAfter a specific period from the customer’s enrolment\nAlong with promotion\nIn this type of expiry, the enrolment expiry remains the same as the promotion end date. For example, if the enrolment expiry is defined as the same as the promotion end date and the expiry date is 30th Apr, then a customer who is enrolled on 1st Apr can complete the issuance activity until 30th Apr, and a customer who is enrolled on 3rd Apr can complete the issuance activity until 30th Apr. The expiry remains the same for all customers in this case, irrespective of when the enrolment happened.\nAfter a specific period from the customer’s enrolment\nIn this type, the promotion expires after N number of days from the customer’s enrolment. For example, if the enrollment expiry is defined as 10 days from the customer’s enrolment, then a customer who is enrolled on 1st Apr can complete the issuance activity until 11th Apr, and a customer who is enrolled on 3rd Apr can complete the issuance activity until 13th Apr.\nYou can define the expiry for issued promotions under\nEnrolment expiry\nin the\nAdvanced settings > Enrolment\nof the promotion.\n📘\nNotes\nThe expiries are calculated based on the store timezone.\nFor Enrol&Issue type of promotion, both enrolment and issual expiry will be defined\nIf a customer is enrolled at the current time, then the expiry of the enrolment will be (current time as per the store time zone + 10 days) considering 10 days is defined as the enrolment expiry.\nIf a customer is issued the promotion at the current time, then the expiry of the issual will be (current time as per the store time zone + 10 days) considering 10 days is defined as the issual expiry.\nThese expiries can be updated when the promotion is upcoming, live or ended.\nDefining limits for enrolment\nEnrolment restrictions are the limits set to keep restrictions on the number of times a customer can be enrolled (Backend term - Issue) in a promotion. By default, this limit is set to 1.\nOnly one enrolment can be active at any point in time for the customer. Suppose a customer is enrolled again in any promotion. In that case, the current enrolment will be replaced and a new expiry will be applicable for the customer based on the new enrolment date.\nThe maximum limit can be 100.\nTo set enrolment restrictions, navigate to\nAdvanced Settings > Enrolment limit\n.\n📘\nNotes\nFor Enrol&Issue type of promotion, both enrolment and issual limits will be defined including issual and redemption of issual\nOnce the restrictions are consumed completely, there will be no more enrolment and issual that can happen for a promotion for a particular customer\nThese limits can be updated when the promotion is upcoming, live or ended.\nDefining issual expiry\nIssual expiry refers to the duration within which a customer must complete the specified activity to receive the benefits of the promotion.\nYou can define the expiry for issued promotions under\nIssual expiry\nin the\nAdvanced settings\nof the promotion.\nThere are two types of expiry:\nAlong with promotion\nAfter a specific period from promotion issual\nAlong with promotion\nWhen the issual expiry is set to \"along with promotion,\" it aligns with the promotion end date. For instance, if the promotion end date is April 30th, then customers who receive the promotion on April 1st can avail of its benefits if they complete the earning activity by April 30th. Similarly, customers who receive the promotion on April 3rd can also enjoy its benefits if they complete the earning activity by April 30th. In this scenario, the expiry remains consistent for all customers, regardless of when the promotion was issued.\nAfter specific period from promotion issual\nIn this, the promotion expires after a specified number of days from the time of issual. For instance, if the issual expiry is set to 10 days from promotion issual, then a customer who receives the promotion on April 1st can avail of its benefits by completing the activity until April 11th. Similarly, a customer who receives the promotion on April 3rd can complete the activity until April 13th to enjoy the benefits of the promotion.\n📘\nNotes\nThe expiries are calculated based on the store timezone.\nThese expiries can be updated when the promotion is upcoming, live or ended.\nDefining limits for issuing promotions and redemption\nYou can define the restrictions for the promotion issued and redemption under\nIssual limit\nin the\nAdvanced settings\n.\nMax times a promotion can be issued to a customer (Backend term - Earn):\nEnter the maximum number of times a promotion can be issued to a customer. The default value is 1.\nMax times one issual can be redeemed\n: Enter the maximum number of times a single issual can be redeemed. The default value is 1.\nBoth issual and redemption limits can have a maximum value of 100.\n📘\nNotes\nOnce the restrictions are completely consumed, further enrolment and issual for a promotion will be unavailable for a particular customer.\nThese limits can be updated while the promotion is in the upcoming, live, or ended state\nEnroling customers for the promotion\nYou can enrol the customers to a promotion using the\nEnrol promotion API\n.\nNotes:\nIf the promotion is a Direct Issue, then this API call will fail as the customer can’t be enrolled in a Direct issue type of promotion.\nIf the promotion is of type Enrol&Issue, then this API will enrol the customer in the promotion.\nIssuing the promotion\nYou can issue the promotion through the Issue promotion action in loyalty workflows and loyalty promotions or using API.\nUsing Issue loyalty promotion action on UI\nUsing API\nYou can use the API\nIssue promotion\nand issue promotion.\nUpdated\n6 months ago\nTable of Contents\nUse Case 1\nUse Case 2\nUse Case 3\nCreating Enrol & Issue type of promotion\nDefining enrolment expiry\nDefining limits for enrolment\nDefining issual expiry\nAfter specific period from promotion issual\nDefining limits for issuing promotions and redemption\nEnroling customers for the promotion\nIssuing the promotion"

To enable these, contact your CSR.\nWhat is a Promotion priority order & stacking strategy and how are they useful?\nPromotion priority order (ranking promotions)\nPromotion Priority Order, also known as the ranking of promotions, allows brands to determine the sequence in which promotions are applied to events such as transactions or registrations. With this feature, brands can specify the order in which promotions are evaluated and applied, providing greater control over the discounts and offers presented to customers.\nPromotion stacking\nIn addition to prioritizing promotions, brands may also want to manage the number of promotions applied to a transaction, whether at the line-item level or for the entire bill, to avoid giving over-discounts. The promotion stacking feature helps limit the number of promotions applied, avoiding excessive discounts and ensuring that only the most relevant promotion is used.\n📘\nNote:\nWhen the Promotions 2.0 feature is enabled, Promotion Priority Order is automatically activated, while the stacking strategy can be enabled or disabled based on brand preferences.\nThe priority order and stacking strategy only evaluate promotions awarding points, i.e the promotions which have point allocation action configured within them.\nConfiguring promotion priority order and the type of ranking order\nYou can configure the promotion priority order in the Advanced settings of the loyalty program. To configure, navigate to\nLoyalty+ programs > Edit Program > Advance Settings > Loyalty Promotions > Promotion Priority order\nIn this section, you can arrange the promotion order types by dragging and dropping them to define the sequence in which promotions will be applied. You can prioritize promotions using the following order types as listed in the table below:\nMaximum points allocation\nPromotions that allocate the maximum number of points will be applied first, in descending order. For example, if Promotion 1 allocates 100 points and Promotion 2 allocates 350 points, Promotion 2 will be applied first, followed by Promotion 1.\nPromotion Expiry\nPromotion expiry - Promotions are applied based on their expiry dates, with those expiring earliest being applied first. For example, if P1 is expiring in 1 month and P2 is expiring in 3 months, P1 will be applied first followed by P2.\nPromotion Weightage\nThis order type is not released and will be available in future.\nBy default, the Priority order is  - Promotion expiry > Maximum points allocation.\nExample\nIf the priority order is set as \"Maximum points allocation\" followed by \"Promotion expiry\", then all promotions that allocate points will be ranked from highest to lowest. Subsequently, promotions will be ranked based on their expiry from earliest to farthest.\nFor instance, consider the below promotions:\nP1: Allocates 100 points, Promotion expiring in the next 30 days\nP2: Allocates 300 points, Promotion expiring in the next 45 days\nP3: Allocates 300 points, Promotion expiring in the next 20 days\nP4: Allocates 200 points, Promotion expiring in the next 10 days\nIn this scenario, the evaluation rank of promotions will be: P3 → P2 → P4 → P1.\nEnabling Promotion Stacking strategy\nYou can configure the promotion priority order in the Advanced settings of the loyalty program. To configure, navigate to\nLoyalty+ → Edit Program→ Advance Settings → Loyalty Promotions > Promotion Stacking Strategy\n.\nThere are two stacking strategy options available:\nMultiple promotions to apply in a transaction at a line-item level:\nStacking for promotions which are running on a line-item level in a transaction.\nMultiple promotions to apply in a transaction at a transaction/bill level:\nStacking for promotions which are running on the entire transaction or bill level in a transaction.\nWhen creating a promotion based on a transaction event, we specify whether the promotion should be applied at the line-item level or the bill level.\nBy default, the Stacking strategy is Off for both types of promotions.\nFunctionality when Stacking strategy is ON\nStacking on refers to the process where multiple promotions are applied within a single transaction. This is the behaviour by default but the stacking strategy helps to enable this in a controlled manner. With the stacking strategy feature, you can define a promotion as Exclusive and Non-exclusive.\nMark this promotion exclusive\nExclusive promotions are the ones, which are treated and evaluated individually. These promotions do not get stacked with any other promotion.\nMark this Promotion non-exclusive\nNon exclusive promotions are the ones which get stacked with other non exclusive promotions, and are treated together as a bundle or stack.\nAlways apply this promotion\nThese promotions will always apply no matter what the stacking strategy is. They are neither exclusive nor non exclusive.\nBenefits of marking promotion exclusive and non-exclusive\nWhen a promotion is marked as exclusive, it is treated as standalone and does not stack with any other promotion. The benefits allocated by the exclusive promotion, such as points or discounts, are considered independently, and the promotion's expiry date is only relevant to itself.\nExample :\nConsider the promotions in the table below and a scenario where the priority order is set as Maximum points allocation > Promotion expiry:\nPromotions\nType\npoints\nExpiry\nP1\nNon-exclusive\n100\n30 days\nP2\nNon-exclusive\n300\n45 days\nP3\nNon-exclusive\n300\n20 days\nP4\nExclusive\n200\n10 days\nFirstly, P1, P2, and P3 will be stacked together, allowing them to potentially allocate a total of 700 points.  P4, being exclusive, is compared with (P1+P2+P3). Since P4 < (P1+P2+P3), a total promotion of 700 (P1+P2+P3) is applied. Among P1, P2, and P3, the priority order will be P3 → P2 → P1.\nDisabling stacking strategy: Turning off and its impact on loyalty promotion behaviour\nWhen Stacking is turned off, only a single promotion will be applied in a transaction. This implies that brands do not want multiple promotions to be applied in a transaction. The single promotion applied will be the one prioritized at the top of the promotion priority order.\nTo disable a stacking strategy, set the toggle switch to off for both\nMultiple promotions to apply in a transaction at a line-item level and Multiple promotions to apply in a transaction at a transaction/bill level\n.\nEnsuring consistent application of a promotion even when the stacking strategy is disabled\nIn addition to the single best promotion, you have the option to apply a promotion persistently in transactions, regardless of the priority order and stacking strategy. For instance, Birthday or Anniversary promotions are intended to always apply irrespective of the configured settings.\nIn such cases, you can enable \"\nAlways apply this promotion\n\" in the Promotion level advanced settings. By checking the “Always apply this promotion” option, the promotion will consistently be evaluated and applied. You can enable during creation or while editing a promotion.\nThe promotions not marked ‘\nAlways apply this promotion\n’, will be ranked, and the one on the top of the priority order will get applied.\nPromotion behaviour during stacking mode changes\nWhen switching from stacking off to on\nIn this scenario, promotions marked as \"always applied\" will retain that designation, while the rest of the promotions (those not marked as \"always applied\") will be labeled as \"Exclusive\".\nWhen switching from stacking on to off\nIn this case, promotions marked as \"always applied\" will retain that designation. However, the remaining promotions (those marked as both exclusive or non-exclusive) will be evaluated individually, and only the best among them will be applied, similar to how the functionality works when stacking is off.\nWhen switching back from stacking off to on\nThis is a rare scenario where stacking was previously on, and promotions were marked as exclusive, non-exclusive, and always applied. After switching stacking off, only \"always applied\" promotions remained. Now, if stacking is turned back on (it's advised to avoid frequent changes in stacking strategies as it disrupts promotion evaluation), the status of each promotion from when stacking was on is restored. Thus, promotions marked as exclusive will regain that status, those marked as non-exclusive will revert to non-exclusive, and \"always applied\" promotions will remain unchanged.\nIn summary, once a promotion is assigned a status, it will remain unchanged until altered when stacking is on. However, when stacking is off, these statuses are disregarded except for the \"always applied\" status.\nExamples\nThe example scenarios below will help you understand more about the ranking and stacking strategy\nScenario 1\nRanking: Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\nStacking Strategy for bill-level promotions: OFF\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions: OFF\nPromotion\nPromotion type - bill level/line-item level\nConfiguration\nPoints awarded\nPromotion applied?\nP1\nBill level\nAlways apply ✅\n100\nYes\nP2\nBill level\n120\nNo\nP3\nBill level\n40\nNo\nP4\nBill level\n150\nYes (Allocating max points)\nP5\nBill level\n130\nNo\nConclusion:\nStacking off ensures only a single promotion applies, prioritizing the one that allocates the maximum points.\nP1, marked for always application, is ensured to be applied.\nAdditionally, P4, which allocates the highest points, is also applied.\nConsequently, only P1 and P4 are applied, resulting in a total of 250 points allocated.\nScenario 2\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - OFF\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - OFF\nHere is the table:\nPromotion\nPromotion type -bill level/line-item level\nConfiguration\nPoints Awarded\nPromotion applied?\nP1\nBill\nAlways apply ✅\n100\nYes (since it's Always apply)\nP2\nLine-item\nL1 -120              L2-100\nApply for L1 (Allocating max points to L1)\nP3\nLine-item\nL1 -50                L2-200\nApply for L2 (Allocating max points to L2)\nP4\nBill\n150\nYes (Allocating max points)\nP5\nBill\n130\nNo\nConclusion :\nWith stacking turned off, only a single promotion will be applied, prioritizing the one that allocates the maximum points.\nSince P1 is marked as always applied, it will be applied automatically.\nAmong the line-item promotions, both P2 and P3 allocate the maximum points to their respective line-items (L1 in P1 and L2 in P2), so they will both apply accordingly.\nAmong the bill-level promotions, P4 allocates the maximum points and will also be applied.\nTherefore, promotions P1, P2, P3, and P4 will be applied, resulting in a total of 570 points allocated.\nScenario 3\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - ON\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - ON\nPromotion\nPromotion type -bill level/line-item level\nConfiguration\nPoints Awarded\nPromotion applied?\nP1\nBill\nAlways apply ✅\n100\nYes (since it's Always apply)\nP2\nBill\nExclusive\n120\nNo (Individually compared to the stack of P4+P5)\nP3\nBill\nExclusive\n40\nNo (Individually compared to the stack of P4+P5)\nP4\nBill\nNon-Exclusive\n150\nYes (Getting stacked with P5 & total 270 points from the stack)\nP5\nBill\nNon-Exclusive\n130\nYes (Getting stacked with P4 & total 270 points from the stack)\nConclusion:\nStacking: On, multiple promotions are applied in the transaction. The non-exclusive will be stacked or bundled together and the entire stack of total points will be compared with all the exclusive promotions individually.\nPromotions P4 and P5 will be bundled together as they are non-exclusive promotions, resulting in a stack totalling 270 points.\nThis stack (P4 + P5) will then be compared with each exclusive promotion individually.\nSince the stack's total points (270) exceed the points allocated by both P2 (120) and P3 (40) individually, the stack (P4 + P5) will be applied.\nAdditionally, P1, which is marked as always applied, will also be applied.\nTherefore, promotions P1, P4, and P5 will be applied.\nPoints allocated: 100 + 150 + 130\nScenario 4\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - ON\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - OFF\nPromotion\nPromotion type -bill level/line-item level\nConfiguration\nPoints Awarded\nPromotion applied?\nP1\nBill\nAlways apply ✅\n100\nYes (since it's Always apply)\nP2\nLine-item\nL1 -120     L2-100\nApply for L1 (Allocating max points to L1)\nP3\nLine-item\nL1-50         L2-200\nApply for L2 (Allocating max points to L2)\nP4\nBill\nExclusive\n150\nYes (Allocating more points compared to other exclusive promotions and the stack of non-exclusive promotions)\nP5\nBill\nExclusive\n130\nNo\nP6\nBill\nNon-Exclusive\n50\nNo\nP7\nBill\nNon-Exclusive\n30\nNo\nConclusion:\nStacking is disabled for line item level promotions, ensuring only the best promotion applies to each line item.\nFor bill-level promotions, stacking is enabled, allowing multiple promotions to apply in the transaction. Non-exclusive promotions are bundled together, and their total points are compared with exclusive promotions individually.\nP1, marked as always applied, will be applied automatically.\nAmong the line-item promotions, both P2 and P3 will apply to their respective line items, as they allocate maximum points to L1 and L2, respectively.\nP6 and P7, being non-exclusive promotions, will be bundled together, allocating a total of 80 points.\nThe stack (P6 + P7) will then be compared with P4 and P5 individually. Since the total points of the stack (80) are less than the points allocated by both P4 (150) and P5 (130) individually, P4 will apply alone as it allocates maximum points and is an exclusive promotion.\nTherefore, promotions P1, P2, P3, and P4 will be applied.\nPoints allocated: 100 + 120 + 200 + 150\nScenario 5\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - OFF\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - ON\nPromotion\nPromotion type -bill level/line-item level\nConfiguration\nPoints Awarded\nPromotion applied?\nP1\nBill\nAlways apply ✅\n100\nYes (since it's Always apply)\nP2\nLine-item\nExclusive\nL1-120          L2-100\nNo\nP3\nLine-item\nNon-exclusive\nL1-50            L2-20\nApply for L1 (Getting stacked with P3 & total 200 points)\nP4\nLine-item\nExclusive\nL1-100         L2-500\nApply for L2 (Allocating more points to L2 compared to other exclusive promotions and the stack of non-exclusive promotions)\nP5\nLine-item\nNon-exclusive\nL1-150         L2-200\nApply for L1 (Getting stacked with P3 & total 200 points)\nP6\nBill\n50\nYes (Allocating max points)\nP7\nBill\n30\nNo\nConclusion:\nStacking is disabled for bill-level promotions, allowing only the best promotion to apply.\nFor line item level promotions, stacking is enabled, permitting multiple promotions to apply in the transaction. Non-exclusive promotions are bundled together, and their total points are compared with exclusive promotions individually.\nIf a single exclusive promotion allocates more points than the entire stack, it takes precedence; otherwise, the stack applies. This evaluation is performed for each line item separately.\nP1, marked as always applied, will be applied automatically.\nAmong the line-item promotions, for L1, both P3 and P5 will apply, as they together allocate the most points. For L2, P4 allocates the most points compared to other exclusive promotions and the stack of non-exclusive promotions.\nAmong the bill-level promotions, both P6 and P7 will apply.\nTherefore, promotions P1, P3 (for L1), P4 (for L2), P5 (for L1), and P6 will be applied.\nPoints allocated: 100 + 50 + 500 + 150 + 50\nScenario 6 :\nRanking - Maximum Points > Promotion Expiry\nStacking Strategy for bill level promotions - ON\nStacking Strategy for line item level promotions - ON\nPromotion\nPromotion type -bill level/line-item level\nConfiguration\nPoints Awarded\nPromotion applied?\nP1\nBill\nAlways apply ✅\n100\nYes (since it's Always apply)\nP2\nBill\nExclusive\n120\nNo (Individually compared to the stack of P4+P5)\nP3\nBill\nExclusive\n40\nNo (Individually compared to the stack of P4+P5)\nP4\nBill\nNon-Exclusive\n150\nYes (Getting stacked with P5&P6. Total 270 points & a coupon from the stack)\nP5\nBill\nNon-Exclusive\n130\nYes (Getting stacked with P4&P6. Total 270 points & a coupon from the stack)\nP6\nBill\nNon-Exclusive\nIssue coupon\nYes (Getting stacked with P4&P5. Total 270 points & a coupon from the stack)\nConclusion:\nWith stacking enabled, multiple promotions will apply in the transaction. Non-exclusive promotions are bundled together, and their total points are compared with exclusive promotions individually.\nP1, marked as always applied, will be applied automatically.\nPromotions P4, P5, and P6 are non-exclusive and will be bundled together as a stack. Together, they allocate 270 points and a coupon. This stack is compared with exclusive promotions P2 and P3 individually.\nThe stack (P4 + P5) allocates more points than both P2 and P3 individually.\nDespite P6 issuing coupons, it will also apply because the stack is elected to apply, as it allocates maximum points.\nTherefore, promotions P1, P4, P5, and P6 will be applied.\nPoints allocated: 100 + 150 + 130\nUse case\nAs a brand, I want to apply a single promotion in the transaction which allocates the maximum number of points, but along with this, I want to apply the Birthday and Anniversary promotions if some customer is eligible for these.\nSolution:\nPriority Order: Maximum Points > Earliest Expiry (To prioritize promotions allocating maximum points)\nStacking Strategy: Off (To ensure only a single promotion is applied)\nPromotion\nBenefit\nPromotion applied?\nP1\n100\nNo\nP2\n250\nYes\nP3-Birthday Promotion\n50\nMarked Always Applied\nP4-Anniversary Promotion\n10% off coupon\nMarked Always Applied\nConclusion:\nP2 will get applied for all the customers, as it gives maximum points i.e 250. Along with this, customers who are eligible for P3 or P4 or both, will also get benefits from them, along with P2.\nUpdated\n7 months ago\nTable of Contents\nWhat is a Promotion priority order & stacking strategy and how are they useful?\nPromotion priority order (ranking promotions)\nPromotion stacking\nConfiguring promotion priority order and the type of ranking order\nExample\nEnabling Promotion Stacking strategy\nFunctionality when Stacking strategy is ON\nDisabling stacking strategy: Turning off and its impact on loyalty promotion behaviour\nEnsuring consistent application of a promotion even when the stacking strategy is disabled\nPromotion behaviour during stacking mode changes\nExamples\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nScenario 3\nScenario 4\nScenario 5\nScenario 6 :\nUse case"

It refines the user interaction by restricting the ability to modify or accidentally delete information. This feature is especially pertinent for managing loyalty programs.\nBackground\nResponding to a frequent enterprise-level request, View Mode addresses the need for granular control over different aspects of loyalty programs. Clients have expressed the importance of role-specific access settings, either Read or Write, for different team members.\nUse-Cases\nData Monitoring: Users who only need to review Loyalty Module configurations, promotions, and programs can have restricted access to prevent accidental changes.\nRole-Based Permissions: Users can be assigned specific access levels, allowing or disallowing the creation and modification of promotions, loyalty programs, tier strategies, points strategies, and tracker conditions.\nNeed for View Mode\nUnrestricted access to the Loyalty Module can result in unintended changes that have substantial implications, including potential negative effects on ROI and brand reputation. View Mode aims to mitigate these risks by providing different modes of access.\nModes\nRead (View): This setting permits 'View Only' access, preventing unintentional configuration changes.\nWrite (Create/Edit): Users with this permission level can create and modify elements like Promotions, Loyalty Programs, Tier Strategies, Points Strategies, and Tracker Conditions.\nBenefits\nRisk Mitigation: The risk of accidental data alteration or deletion is significantly reduced.\nOperational Efficiency: Team members can access only the data and features necessary for their roles, thereby ensuring a focused and efficient workflow.\nView (Read Only) in Loyalty +\nProgram Level Changes:\nDisabled the functionality of edit access for the members who have view-only Access.\nUsers can view Program configurations within the organization, user can check the tiers information, Rewards Currency, Trackers, workflow, etc.\nImage: Edit Program Functionality is disabled.\nIn phase 1 we have enabled visibility of the below actions. We will add support for other actions later\nPoints allocation action\nIssue coupon\nForward to set\nTracker Evaluation\nPoints Allocation Action\n: Within the point allocation actions, the edit/save options are completely disabled for a user with view-only access as shown in the image attached below.\nForward to set action\n: Once the settings are saved, a user can not play around with the toggle button to change the existing settings done.\nTrackers\n: Within the Workflow, Users with view-only access can see which tracker is been configured but can’t change the tracker. To view which tracker has been configured in the action, the user has to click on the \"eye\" icon on the right side of the tracker action bar.\nPromotions level changes:\nCreate promotions:\nThe view mode in loyalty promotions disables the “Create Promotion” functionality and thus a user with view-only access can not “Create Promotion”.\nEdit Promotions:\nUsers can view the existing promotions and respective configuration but on clicking the three dots, the EDIT option is disabled.\nPromotion Workflows:\nWithin the Promotion workflows with a view access\nThe user can not change or add the set conditions.\nThe user can not change the workflow expression as well.\nA user with view access cannot change actions or edit the actions, In the below image the functionality to enable or disable existing settings of the “forward to set” action can not be altered and thus a user with view access of promotions can not edit the existing configurations of the promotions.\nAdvance Settings of Promotions:\nWith the view-only access, a user can not edit the advance settings as well. In the image attached below all the edit, save, and toggle buttons are disabled and thus can’t be changed.\nWay to get View Only Access :\nTo enable the view-only access please write to the access team.\nIf you want to have edit/approve/delete access, make sure you are tagging your manager in the access request email before sending it to the access team.\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nView Role in Loyalty Module\nProgram Level Changes:\nPromotions level changes:"

These serve as a form of gamification and a sense of pride and accomplishment within the user, reinforcing the targeted behaviours and boosting engagement.\nPurposes and benefits\nCustomers want to build deeper relationships with brands beyond transaction and that’s where emotional loyalty comes into play. Customers are recognized and appreciated for the effort that they put in, the money they spend, and their loyalty towards the same brand. Hence, Badges tap into the emotional side of the customers making them hooked to your brand, giving a more fulfilling experience, moving beyond the realm of mere transactions and discounts.\nUse cases\nTravel and Hospitality Vertical\nFuel Vertical\nFashion and Retail Vertical\nCPG Vertical\nSample End Customer (Cx) Journeys\nNew member/welcome badges\nCx registers in brand’s loyalty program\nUpon successful registration, Cx is automatically awarded the “New Member” badge\nCx receive the associated benefits with the badge.\nCx receives a notification about earning the badge and associated benefits\nA badge is displayed in Cx’s loyalty program account\nCx feels proud and accomplished after receiving the badge on registering and continues to engage with the brand to receive more badges\nActivity based badges\nCx completes specific actions such as making a purchase, writing a review, or referring friends.\nEach completed action unlocks a new badge, such as \"First Purchase,\" \"Reviewer,\" or \"Referral Champion.\"\nCx is notified of their earned badges and can view them in their loyalty program account.\nCustomer views for Badges\nCustomers can see the available and earned badges in their mobile app. Clicking on a particular badge also gives information about what the customer has to do to earn the badge, the benefits associated with the badge, the earning period and other details.\nCustomers can proudly share their badges on social media and become advocates for your brands.

There is no requirement for customers to enroll in the badge beforehand. For example, you can create a directly issued badge that is available to all customers who complete a particular action or achieve a specific milestone. Once the criteria are met, the badge is awarded to the customer without any further steps required.\nEnrol and issue badges (Issue earn)\nEnrol and issue badges require customers to first enrol in the badge before they can earn it. Customers must actively opt-in or sign up for the badge program. Once enrolled, they need to complete the designated activity or meet the specified requirements to qualify for the badge. Only after fulfilling these prerequisites will the badge be issued to the customer. This approach adds a step where customers express their interest or commitment to earning the badge before they can receive it, potentially increasing engagement and participation in the badge program.\nUpdated\nabout 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nDirect issue (Earn)\nEnrol and issue badges (Issue earn)"

Live, upcoming, ended badges can be active but only live and upcoming badges can be inactive.\nYou can filter badges based on the\nBadge issue type\n,\nOwned by\nand\nClaimed by\nby selecting the\nAdvanced filters\nicon.\nTo view the the owner and claim details for a particular badge,  click  on the\ni\nicon against the badge owner\nFor a badge to be claimed by a particular module, first the owner has to be defined and then that module can claim it.\nA badge can have multiple owners and claims\nOnce an owner is defined, it can’t be removed or replaced, but more owners can be added to the badge.\nOnce a claim has been added for a badge, it can’t be removed or replaced, but other modules can still claim it.\nThe claim gives the information of exactly where the badge is being used/claimed. For example, in the below screenshot, the badge has been claimed in supermarket loyalty program : TransactionAdd and CustomerRegistration events\nIf a badge owner is defined, but claims are not yet added then it will be shown as below :\nNot claimed\nWe can see the list of badges that were claimed from Audience Campaigns and Journeys using the tooltip and the 'View Badge' option.\nViewing badge detail\nYou can click on a badge to view all the details of the particular badge.\nIn the Configuration tab, there are three sections:\nBasic details\nImages : Unissued, In progress and Issued\nName : Name for the badge.

Brands can define the restrictions in the combination of the below options.\nFixed Window: With a fixed window, badges must be issued within a specific, predetermined time period.\nMoving Window: A moving window, on the other hand, offers more flexibility. It tracks performance over a rolling time frame, such as the last 30 days.

This custom data can be used for various purposes such as displaying personalized information within the app or website, and for accounting or reporting purposes.\nAdditionally, this custom data can also help brands to track and analyze the performance of their badges, and make data-driven decisions to improve their badges strategy. Furthermore, the ability to include custom data can also help brands to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and to report on the performance of the badges to stakeholders.\nUsecase\nA retail brand aims to establish a badges platform to reward loyal customers and foster engagement through their mobile app. To personalize the badge experience, the brand intends to display custom information associated with each badge earned by users. To implement this the brand can perform the following:\nCreate a custom field named \"Terms & Conditions\" with the data type set as STRING.\nCreate a badge and assign this custom field \"Terms & Conditions,\" ensuring to populate it with relevant information.\nWhen a customer earns the badge, it will be showcased along with the \"Terms & Conditions\" field, providing users with pertinent details about the badge. Examples of custom field content may include terms and conditions, redemption instructions, brief descriptions, legal text, exclusivity status, purpose, etc.\nNotes\nCustom fields can be created, updated, or disabled.\nThere can be only one active custom field with the same name. If the existing custom field is disabled, then a new custom field with the same name can be created.\nIt is mandatory to define the default value for a custom field which is mandatory for the badge. In case a badge doesn't define a mandatory custom field with it, the default value will be considered.\nData types supported in custom fields: boolean, integer, string, and date.\nOnce the custom field is disabled, it can't be enabled again.\nOnly active custom fields will be returned in all the getcalls.\nOnly below fields can be updated while updating the custom field:\nName : can be updated\nIsactive : can be updated from true to false but false to true is not allowed\nDefault value can be updated\nIsmandatory can be updated from true to false or false to true\nData type can’t be updated\nThere is no limit on the number of custom fields that can be defined at an org level for badges.\nCreating Custom Fields from Badges UI\nStart by navigating to the badges UI and go to\nSettings\n.\nSelect the option to\nCreate Custom field\n.\nIn the\nName\nfield, enter a name for the custom field and from the\nData type\ndrop-down, select the appropriate data type. The supported data types are Boolean, Date, Number and String. There is no limit set on the number of characters.\nTo set the custom field to mandatory, set it to Yes.

This enables sorting customers' badge collections and highlighting their achievements.\nFor example, in the below screenshot, Limited Edition badges have a higher priority followed by Monthly challenge badges, Workout badges, and Close your Rings badges. Within each defined group, badges are sorted based on their rank.\nExample\nConsider three badge groups, Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 ranked 1, 2, and 3. While creating badges, Badge 1 is tagged with Group 1, Badge 2 is tagged with Group 2, and Badge 3 doesn't have any group tagged but has a badge rank of 1.\nRetrieving badges list\nIn the above scenario, when you retrieve the list of badges available for a customer, the system prioritizes based on the defined groups and badge ranks. Initially, the list is ordered as Badge 1, then Badge 2, and finally Badge 3 (due to the group tag of Badge 3 being null but having a rank).\nImpact on deleting a group\nIf a group is deleted the order of the badges also changes.  For example, if Group 1 is deleted, fetching the badge list will now prioritize Badge 2 first (as it belongs to Group 2), then Badge 3 (due to its rank), and finally Badge 1.\nThe sorting of the badges is performed using the sortOn parameter in the\nGet customer badge API\n.\nSorting logic:\nPreference will be given to the groups as per their ranking\nWithin the group, preference will be given to the badges for which badge rank is defined, the rest of the badges with no badge rank will be sorted in default descending order of expired date\nIf badges with no group are defined, they will be sorted in order of badge rank (if defined), followed by default descending order of expired date\nCreating a Group and Assigning a Rank to It\nTo create the group\nStart by navigating to the badges UI settings.\nGo to the badges UI settings.\nNavigate to the group section and click on \"New Group\". Here, you'll create a new group.\nName the group, for example, \"Summer Group\". Give your group a name.\nAssign a rank to the group, for example, \"4\". The rank indicates the group's priority.\nClick on \"Save\".\nYou'll see that the group is now created. You have options to edit or delete the group.\nTo edit the group:\nClick on \"Edit Group\".\nYou can change the group's name and rank.\nChange the group name, for example, to \"Summer_group_12\".\nChange the group rank, for example, to \"3\". This will change the group's priority.\nClick on \"Save\" and Save your changes to apply them.\nTo verify the group's creation:\nClick on \"Create a Badge\".\nIn the badge group section, you'll see the newly created group.\nCheck the badge group drop-down. Your new badge group, \"Summer_group_12\", appears in the drop-down. And you can now assign the badge to the group you created.\nBadge Group APIs\nYou can use the below APIs to Create, Edit, Update and Retrieve the Badge details.\nCreate Group\nUpdate Group\nGet Group by ID\nGet all Groups\nCreate badges with Group and Badge Rank\nUpdate badges with Group and Badge Rank\nNotes\nGroup name must be unique within the active groups in an org\nGroup rank is mandatory but there is no uniqueness on group rank\nBadge rank is non-mandatory\nGroups can be disabled by making the isActive flag false\nUpdated\n7 months ago\nTable of Contents\nExample\nRetrieving badges list\nImpact on deleting a group\nSorting logic:\nCreating a Group and Assigning a Rank to It\nTo create the group\nTo edit the group:\nTo verify the group's creation:\nBadge Group APIs\nNotes"

The issuance date (when the badge is awarded) triggers additional rewards or perks triggered by awarding the badge.\nIssuance expiry\n: Badges expire based on the current date/processing date, not the event date.\nTimezone: Retroactive badge issuances consider the timezone configured at the organisational level.\nRestrictions:\nFixed Windows badge constraint - If selected, restrictions will be checked based on the event date if fixed Windows restrictions are chosen for the badge.\nRolling windows badge constraint  - Restrictions based on rolling windows are not handled in retro enrolment.\nHandling upcoming, live and expired badges\nBadge Scenario\nBadge type\nHandling Approach\nAdditional API Considerations\nUpcoming Badges\n-\nRetroactive Handling: Not Applicable\n-\nActive Badge Scenarios\nEnrol & Issue\n- Expired Enrolment: No retroactive handling. Requires re-enrolment before issuance for the badge issue. The badge issue date will be calculated based on the current processing date.\n- Enrol API: The event date must align with the badge's active period.\nDirect enrolment and issue\nDirectly issue the badge.\n-\nExpired Badges\nEnrol & Issue Type\n- Valid Enrolment: Directly issue the badge. - Expired Enrolment: Enrol first, then issue. - No Enrolment: Enrol first, then issue.\n- Enrol API: The event date must align with the badge's active period. - Issue API: The event date must fall between the enrolled event date and the enrolment expiry.\nDirect enrolment & issue\nDirectly issue the badge.\n-\nConfiguring retroactive badge issuance window\nYou can define the period that needs to be considered for the customer's past actions.\nTo define, perform the following:\nNavigate to\nIntouch > Organisation settings > Billing\n.\nDefine the below configurations:\nCONF_CLIENT_RETRO_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS\n: This parameter determines the maximum allowed age (in days) for retroactive transactions. For example, if the value is set to 30 days, customers can claim badges for transactions that occurred within the last 30 days from the registration date.\nCONF_CLIENT_RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS\n: This parameter introduces a buffer time or delay (in hours) since customer registration before they can claim retroactive badges.\nFor more information on Retro transactions, refer to the\nRetro transaction documentation\n.\nNote:\nIf the badge metadata such as the end date of the badge changes, the time until which the badge can be issued retroactively will also change based on the retro configs defined at an org level. For example, if the configured retro days are 30 and the badge expiry date is extended for 10 days, the retroactive days will be calculated from this new expiry date.\nExample\nConsider a badge with the following characteristics:\nActive period: October 1st to 15th\nType: Enrol&Issue (requires both enrolment and issuance)\nEnrolment expiry: 2 days after enrolment\nBadge issuance expiry: 2 days after issuance\nCurrent date: October 20th\nenrolEventDate\n: October 10th\nRetro days configured to 30 days\nScenario\nDescription\nEnrolment status\nThe enrol instance succeeds as the enrol event date is between the badge start date and end date and will expire on October 12th.\nIssueEventDate\n: October 14th\nAs the enrolment expires on October 12th, this will result in an invalid issue event of the badge.\nIssue event date: October 11th\nFixed Restriction (a customer can be issued a maximum of two badges  every three days)\n- If a single badge was issued between the 10th to 12th Oct, the customer will receive an additional badge on October 11th.\n- If two badges were issued between the 10th to 12th Oct, the customer is ineligible for any further badges.\n- If no badge was issued between the 10th to 12th Oct, the customer will receive a badge on October 11th.\nIssue event date: October 20th.\n-  customer reports a \"badge not issued\" complaint irrespective of his/her eligibility\n- Restriction: Rolling window (Customer can get the badge twice in last 2 days)\n- Issue instances on the current date will be checked, if two badges were issued in the previous two days,  the badge will not be issued to the customer\n- On 20th Oct, if only one badge was issued to the customer for the last two days, the customer will be issued one more badge\n- If on 20th Oct no badge was issued for the last 2 days, the customer will be issued one badge\n- Expiry: The expiry of the badge is calculated from the current date, hence this issue will expire on 22nd Oct\nIssue event date: Oct 20th\nCustomer registers on Oct 20th for loyalty\nBadge not issued irrespective of eligibility.\nRefer to the APIs below:\nEnroll customers in badges\nIssue badge to the customer\nUpdated\nabout 1 year ago\nTable of Contents\nOverview:\nKey concepts:\nHandling upcoming, live and expired badges\nConfiguring retroactive badge issuance window\nExample\nRefer to the APIs below:"

Onboarding can be performed for only one Till in an org. The till code is necessary for onboarding organizations in Marvel because it enables the Gamification application to make an InTouch API call. This call validates the customer by retrieving their details and ensuring they are valid. Without the till code, the Gamification application cannot perform this validation during the onboarding process.\nCreate Rewards\nTo create rewards on the Marvel UI, perform the following:\nGo to the old UI of Capillary and type Marvel in the search bar.\nClick on Marvel Rewards. You will be redirected to the below page for your org\nTo create a new reward, click on the + icon on the top right corner. Enter all the fields mentioned below:\n❗️\nNote:\nEnsure that an external points system (e.g., Bonus Link) is configured when enabling external points redemption at the organization level. If external points APIs are not configured, the \"Create Reward\" option in the UI will remain disabled.\na. Type - Select the type of reward you want to create (e.g., points, voucher, free voucher). This is just a metadata.\nVouchers: Digital coupons generated against redeeming customer points. For example, redeem 50 points for a 10% off coupon.\nPhysical voucher: Physical coupons generated against redeeming customer points. For example, redeem 150 points for a flat 150 off coupon.\nFree voucher: Digital coupons generated without any points redemption.\nb. Priority - Set the priority level for the reward (e.g., high, medium, low or 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on). This is a metadata for the reward.\nc. Category - Select the category for the reward (e.g., fashion, electronics, groceries). You can create the categories in the category section in Marvel. This is a metadata for the reward.\nd. Subscription - This is not working and to be ignored while creating a reward.\ne. Advanced Filtering - Use filters such as tier, group, or label to specify the target audience for the reward. This is a metadata for the reward. The character limit for tiers, groups, and labels is 255 characters each.\nf. Intouch Points - Define the number of intouch points required to purchase a reward.\ng. Redemption type - Define the redemption type if it is intouch reward or vendor reward or cart promotion.\nInTouch only rewards: These are points or coupons created in Capillary and uses Capillary APIs.\nVendor only rewards: These are either points or coupons created at the vendor end. Capillary uses vendor specific APIs directly to identify and issue rewards. In this case, there will be no data at the Intouch side and redemption doesn’t happen in Capillary.I\nVendor Intouch reward:\n🚧\nAttention\nIt is not recommended to use the\nVendor Intouch reward\nredemption type. Instead, you can use the\nVendor only reward\nredemption type to issue coupons directly through the vendor API.\nHere, the system will use the vendor specific API to issue vendor coupons and after receiving a successful response from the API, the system will use the\ncapillary issue coupon\nAPI to issue coupons and retrieve the coupon codes. This redemption type helps to track the number of coupons issued to customers through the vendor system.\nCart Promotion rewards: These are promotions created in Capillary.\nh. Vendor and vendor redemption\nIn Vendor redemption, you can configure rewards linked to a particular vendor. You can also configure multiple actions in a single vendor redemption, for example, one to check if the customer has points and another to issue the reward.\n❗️\nNote:\nEnsure that an external points system (e.g., Bonus Link) is configured when enabling external points redemption at the organization level. If external points APIs are not configured, the \"Create Reward\" option in the UI will remain disabled.\nBegin by creating the reward partners. Navigate to the rewards vendor section\nClick on the plus icon and assign a name to your reward partner, such as \"target\". Assign key-value pairs to the target. These will be used in all vendor redemptions created in subsequent steps. You can add frequently used fields as key-value pairs here. Then, click on save and create the vendor.\nWith the vendor created, select \"target\" and create vendor redemptions. Vendor redemption under vendor means specific APIs for the target will be called, created as a partner reward, and later linked to the catalog item.\nClick on the plus icon and assign a name to your vendor redemption. Choose the type of reward, such as miles, cash wallet, cashback card, discount, charity games, vouchers, sweepstakes, auction, etc.\nActions are the APIs that will be called to issue this particular reward. Assign an execution order to the actions.\nProvide the API URL for the vendor and specify the API type.\nAdd the request body. Specify the redemption value and mobile number as variables here which will be passed in the request to issue a reward call. You can also include custom fields, fulfilment status and reward transaction ID in the API body. The fulfilment status and the reward transaction ID are variables resolved in the backend according to the associated transaction.\nCustom Field\n: Enables brands to add additional data in the API request. Use the format\ncustomfield_customFieldName\n. For example, a custom field named \"Address: Bangalore\" should be written as customfield_Address then it will replace the value of custom field with Bangalore.\nNote:\nOnly custom field created with\nISSUE REWARD\nscope is supported.\nFulfillment Status:\nEnables to update the fulfilment status. Use the parameter fulfillmentStatus, formatted in camelCase.\nReward Transaction ID\n: Enables to add the reward transaction ID. This helps the vendor to identify the transaction associated with the issued reward.  Use the parameter rewardTransactionId, formatted in camelCase.\nNOTE:\nThe API body supports other parameters that can be included based on the brand's specific requirements or integration needs.\nInternal Capillary APIs can also be used.\nsample api payload with custom field, transaction id and fulfilment status\n,\n    \"apiBody\" : \"{\\\"transactionId_property\\\": \\\"${rewardTransactionId}\\\",\\\"customFields_property\\\": {\\\"customField_1_property\\\": \\\"${customfield_CF1}\\\"}, \\\"fulfillmentStatus_property\\\": \\\"${fulfillmentStatus}\\\"}\",\nAPI headers contain authentication details and content-type. Enter the authorization in the API headers and save them by clicking on the + icon. Add more API headers as needed and save them.\nContext keys contain the response of the vendor. Specify the fields to return in the response. Enter \"voucher\" as a mandatory param if storing any code or unique id. Provide the path of the response as value for that particular field.\nSelect the response value needed in the issue reward response block and click on save to save the vendor redemption.\nCreate as many vendor redemptions as needed under a particular reward vendor.\nOnce the vendor redemptions are created, return to the reward creation and create a new reward and select the vendor and vendor redemption to be linked to this reward.\n👍\nNote\nThere is no limit on the number of rewards you can create.\nExample 1 for vendor redemptions\nExample 2 for vendor redemptions\ni. start and end date of the redemption period. While creating the reward, start date must be in the future.\nj. Geographies - Select the country where the reward is applicable. This is a metadata for the reward.

Create the languages in the languages section of Marvel and use them while creating a reward.\nPoints Vendor: Brands can either use Capillary as the points vendor or use their own loyalty platform or partnered platform and do the configuration here in the Points vendor section of Marvel. This allows brands to use rewards catalog even if they don’t use Capillary as their loyalty product.\nEnable this option to define third party vendors for points redemption in the Points vendor section of Marvel.\nOnce you have filled in all the required fields, click on the Save button to create the reward.\nUse cases\nIntouch Rewards - Coupons & Cart Promotions\nGet a 20% discount upto 100 on your next transactions.\nRedeem 500 points and get this offer\nExternal or Vendor based rewards\nGet 10 AirCap miles for every 10000 points you redeems\nGet a recharge of 100 for 500 points\nPoints to Note\nIf a reward is enabled, then it will be returned in the get call.

By setting limits on the number of rewards that can be purchased, brands can control the overall cost of the program and ensure that it is financially sustainable.\nEncourage targeted behavior: Setting limits on rewards can encourage customers to engage with the brand in a more targeted and effective way. For example, setting a limit on the number of rewards that can be purchased can encourage customers to make more frequent or larger purchases.\nCreate a sense of exclusivity: Setting limits on rewards can create a sense of exclusivity and scarcity, which can make the rewards more valuable and appealing to customers.\nPromote fairness: Setting limits on rewards can help to promote fairness among customers and ensure that the rewards are distributed fairly among all members of the loyalty program.\nHelp brands to evaluate the effectiveness of the program: Setting limits on rewards can help brands to evaluate the effectiveness of the loyalty program, by measuring the number of rewards purchased. This information can be used to make data-driven decisions about how to improve the program in the future.\nConfigurations Allowed:\nAs a marketing manager, you can now define the below reward limits:\nMax times a customer can purchase the reward in the reward duration\nper day\nper week (last 7 days)\nper month (last 30 days)\nOverall limit\nMax times the reward can be purchased across customers\nper day\nper week (last 7 days)\nper month (last 30 days)\nOverall limit\nSet limit as 0 : Support KPI value 0. User can set this 0 any time\nUpdate reward restrictions at any time\nRemove restrictions at any time\nAudit logs for all updates in reward constraints\nKPI Terms\nLevel\nCustomer Level - Only impacts particular customer\nReward Level - Impacts all customers of the reward\nKPI\nQuantity - Number of rewards of the same type being bought.\nRepeatFrequencyType\nCurrently only 3 repeat frequencies are considered.\nDAY\nMONTH\nWEEK\nInterval\nThe interval for which repeat frequency has to be considered. example: Last 3 weeks, last 2 days.\nValidations\nNo validation on limits, i.e limit can be any number from 1 to MAX\nIf multiple restrictions with the same KPI and repeatFrequencyType are passed for a particular level, the value will be replaced with the latest value.\nExample :\n\"reward\": [  \n            {  \n                \"kpi\": \"QUANTITY\",  \n                \"limit\": 2,  \n                \"repeatFrequencyType\": \"DAY\",  \n                \"interval\": 10,  \n            },  \n            {  \n                \"kpi\": \"QUANTITY\",  \n                \"limit\": 20,  \n                \"repeatFrequencyType\": \"DAY\",  \n                \"interval\": 30,  \n            }  \n        ]\nThe final value of this KPI will be limit 20 and interval of 30\nGet started here,\nThis feature is not yet available on UI, refer to the below API documentations:\nCreate Reward\nUpdate Reward\nGet Brand Rewards\n📘\nPoints to Note\nIf no consumption restriction is added the reward will always be available for issual, i.e unlimited availability.\nThe repeat frequency types are always considered rolling, time frames will be calculated with respect to the current date and set duration interval.\nAny one or all of repeat frequency types (such as per day, per week, per month) can be configured at every consumption restriction level of the reward.\nAdding constraints on an expired reward is not allowed.\nAdding the reward restrictions post the reward is live can result in users breaching the reward constraint. For example,\nDay 1 10:00 AM : User 1 purchased 5 qty of Reward1\nDay 1  01:00 PM : On Reward1,  Customer level constraints are added, KPI-Quantity, limit = 2, freq=DAYS, interval = 1\nDay 1  02:00 PM : User 1 tries to purchase Reward1. System will allow this action.\nDay 1  02:30 PM : User 1 tries to purchase Reward1. System will allow this action.\nDay 1  02:40 PM : User 1 tries to purchase Reward1. System will not allow this action as the customer level limit only allows 2 qty and this call fails.\nThis means that the issue summary is captured only after the reward has some constraints added to it.\nIf reward is enabled, then disabled, and then enabled again, then the interval doesn’t ignore the duration when the reward was disabled. For example,\n10th May 2023 : Reward was created, enabled and the restrictions were defined at the customer level. Maximum number of times a customer could purchase a particular reward was set to 10 with interval 5 days\nHere, Customer1 purchased 10 quantities of a reward.\n12th May 2023: Reward was marked as disabled\n15th May 2023: Reward was enabled again and customer tried to purchase 5 quantities of the same reward\nHere, the system will check the last 5 days i.e. from 10th May to 15th May.\nThis means that the duration in which reward was disabled is not ignored when the system checks the last n days.\nUpdated\n8 months ago"

This custom data can be used for various purposes such as displaying personalized information within the app or website, and for accounting or partner reconciliation purposes.\nAdditionally, this custom data can also help brands to track and analyze the performance of their rewards, identify customer preferences and behavior, and make data-driven decisions to improve their rewards strategy. It can also be used to personalize communication with customers, and to segment and target customer groups based on their preferences and behavior.\nFurthermore, the ability to include custom data can also help brands to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and to report on the performance of their rewards to stakeholders.\nPoints to note:\nCustom fields can be created, updated, or disabled\nThere can be only one active custom field with the same name. If the existing custom field is disabled, then a new custom field with the same name can be created\nIt is mandatory to define the default value for a custom field which is mandatory for the reward. In case a reward doesn't define a mandatory custom field with it, the default value will be considered\nOnce the custom field is disabled, it can't be enabled again\nOnly active custom fields will be returned in all the getcalls\n📘\nThere is no limit on the number of custom fields that can be defined at an org level for rewards catalog.\nUI for the configuration will come in future sprints. Refer to the below images for reference.\nFor more information on the APIs, check below links:\ncreate custom field\nupdate custom field\nget all custom fields\nUpdated\n8 months ago"

Similarly while doing the purchase from the reward catalog, we support the functionality to use the points across the programs.\nThis allows customers to redeem rewards from multiple programs at once and make the most of their accumulated points.\nThis feature also allows customers to easily compare the rewards available across all programs and make informed decisions about how to redeem their points.\nIt also simplifies the redemption process for customers as they do not have to navigate through multiple programs to redeem their rewards.\nThis feature also allows MLP organizations to better track and manage the redemption of points across multiple programs, and make data-driven decisions to optimize their rewards strategy.\nIt also allows customers to redeem rewards with more ease and flexibility.\nUser journey:\nThe customer will first choose the reward, then view the available rewards they wish to purchase.\nWhen attempting to buy a reward, the system will check the customer's points balance across all programs\nPoints redemption will occur dynamically based on the customer's available points across all programs.\nOnce the points are used, reward will be issued to the customer.\nTo get started:\nIf group redemption is not enabled simply raise a ticket to sustenance for the same\nUpdated\n8 months ago"

Leading to poor customer experience and grievance handling.\nEnhancement\nWith the new updates, brands can now view the transaction, reward, point details against a reward in Member care. The Vendor Rewards flow now includes the display of coupon codes, providing visibility to users.\nTo get started,\nGo to Membercare >> Events >> Rewards catalog\nUnder the Rewards catalog section, you will see all the events for the rewards redeemed by the customer\nA quick view card on the left shows\nReward description : 150 off on handbags…..\nTransaction Status : Successful/Failed\nRedemption Date and Time : 03 Feb 2023 10:34 am\nTransaction ID : 30287\nClick on a particular event to see the detailed reward details, transaction details, points details, reward purchase limits and custom attributes.\nFollowing are the details of the attributes:\nAttribute\nDescription\nReward type\nCoupon/ Promotions/ Gift Voucher/ Free Voucher/ Product\nReward ID\nID of the reward created in the system\nQuantity\nQuantity of the rewards purchased\nReward Partner\nName of the reward partner. Ex: Boat, Lifestyle etc.\nCoupon series ID\nSeries ID of the coupons bought\nCoupon codes\nCodes of coupons bought. Can be multiple in case of multiple quantities\nPromotion name\nName of the promotion issued\nPromotion ID\nID of the promotion issued\nEarned promotion IDs\nEarn IDs of the promotion issued. Can be multiple in case of multiple quantities.\nTerms & conditions of reward\nTerms and condition of the reward (if any) declared during the reward creation\nPoints used * Quantity\nPoints redeemed to purchase a single reward * Quantity of rewards purchased\nCurrency partner name\nPoints vendor (Intouch/Capillary or Bonuslink)\nRedemption ID\nRedemption reference number generated by currency partner\nCustom Attributes\nCustom fields and its value\nReward Purchase Limits >> Individual Member Limits\nMax. reward quantity per member for reward purchases (Daily limit, Weekly limit, Monthly limit, Overall limit)\nReward Purchase Limits >> Across Member Limits\nMax. reward quantity across members for reward purchases (Daily limit, Weekly limit, Monthly limit, Overall limit)\nTo search for a particular reward,\nIn Search, enter the transaction ID or the reward description to see the details of a particular event\nClick on the event card you are looking for on the left panel\nOnce clicked, you can see all the attributes of the selected event i.e. reward, transaction and point details\nReward and Transaction Details\nPoints Details\nReward Limit Details\nCustom Fields Details\nPlease note, this enhancement is done on the new UI of Membercare.\nIn case you’re still using old UI of membercare, then, to see the Reward Catalog events in Membercare, add the following to the URL:\n/member-care/ui/\nThis will take you to the new UI of membercare.\nUpdated\n7 months ago"

Consequently, brands were unable to display accurate error messages to end users.\nReward Issuance could fail at any of the below steps and hence proper error message was required to show to the end users for better customer experience:\nisRedeemable >> checks if the customer has enough points to redeem the reward\nissueReward/issueCoupon >> coupon is issued to the customer\nRedeemPoints >> points are redeemed from customer’s account\nissueCouponReversal >> In case reward is issued but points are not deducted, then reward reversal will take place at this step\nPreviously, in case of failure in the above steps, following response would be generated:\n{\n    \"status\": {\n        \"success\": false,\n        \"code\": 8004,\n        \"message\": \"fail to issue reward as issue failed\"\n    }\n    rewards:null\n}\nEnhancement\nWith the recent enhancement, error messages from partners can now be retrieved and included in the response. This will allow brands to display accurate error messages to the end-users in case of reward issuance failures making the customer experience better.\nAfter the enhancement, in case of failure, following response would be generated:\n{\n    \"status\": {\n        \"success\": false,\n        \"code\": 8004,\n        \"message\": \"fail to issue reward as : IsRedeemable API failed CardNumberRequired &NumberNotFound\",\n        \"partnerError\": {\n            \"codes\": [\n                \"100106\",\n                \"100105\"\n            ],\n            \"messages\": [\n                \"CardNumberRequired\",\n                \"NumberNotFound\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"rewards\":null  \n}\n{\n    \"status\": {\n        \"success\": false,\n        \"code\": 1010,\n        \"message\": \"Points redeem API failed: Invalid token - not found\",\n        \"partnerError\": {\n            \"codes\": [\n                \"990102\"\n            ],\n            \"messages\": [\n                \"Invalid token - not found\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"rewards\": null\n}\nTable showing different error codes and corresponding message and comments\nError code\nMessage\nComments\n8004\nfail to issue reward as\nIssue failed while getting customer details or isRedeemable check or redeem points check.\n8003\nfail to issue reward\n1.

This allows brands to manage rewards efficiently by allocating them to specific loyalty programs (MLPs), reducing clutter in the rewards catalog.\nExample:\nIf a customer holds five cards from different programs, you can configure the catalog to filter and display only the rewards associated with those specific programs, ensuring the customer sees rewards relevant to their memberships.\nPersonalization can be based on:\nLoyalty program\nTier\nSupplementary programs\nSegments and partitions\nCustomer labels\nCard series\nConfiguration Guidelines\nWhile configuring a reward, you can specify the list of program IDs along with the associated tiers, supplementary programs, or segments.\nExisting rewards can be updated to add or remove programs, tiers, supplementary programs, or segments.\nA single reward can be mapped to multiple loyalty programs.\nA single reward can also be mapped to multiple segments and partitions.\nIf a reward is mapped only to a loyalty program and no tier or supplementary program is specified, it will be available to all customers in that program, regardless of their tier or supplementary program.\nRewards can be mapped either to loyalty program criteria (tier and supplementary program) or to customer segments—but not both at the same time.\nOnce a segment is linked to a reward, that reward will only be available to customers within that segment.\nAPI changes and validations\nCreate reward API\nAPI doc for create reward\nsupplementaryCriteria and segmentCriteria are optional fields.\nAll the passed IDs are validated for the org\nUpdate Reward API\nAPI doc for update reward\nsupplementaryCriteria and segmentCriteria are optional fields.\nAll the passed IDs are validated for the org\nThe segments  and partition should be valid and active segment\nIf null is passed the existing mapping will not be affected\nIf empty list is passed all the existing mappings will be removed\nIssue rewards\nAPI doc for issue user reward\nAPI doc for issue bulk reward\nValidation against customer’s programIDs and segmentIDs.\nIf program IDs don’t match for a particular reward in the issueReward call, then that particular reward is not issued and an error message is thrown. Rest of the rewards are issued.\nGet all rewards for the brand\nAPI doc for get brand rewards\nEnd point: user/reward/brand/{brandName}\nA new parameter for accepting the customer identifier is added but this parameter is not mandatory.\nIf a customer identifier is present, it will only return the rewards which are mapped to the customer’s program IDs or segment IDs and general rewards where no programs are mapped.\nAll Get reward APIs will be fetching the partner program details linked to the reward\nTo get the loyalty program ID, navigate to the loyalty module and click on the program. The URL displays the program ID as shown below\nTo retrive the tier ID, you can use insights or PMA to fetch the IDs\nTo retrieve the subscription program ID, head to the loyalty module and click on the program. Under Program, click on subscription program and it will give you the ID for the subscription programs like below\nSample Request Payload\n\"supplementaryCriteriaRO\": [\n    {\n

When they log into the rewards catalog, they should only see rewards relevant to the specific loyalty program associated with the card used for purchases. By filtering rewards based on program IDs, brands can ensure that customers are presented with rewards applicable to their current loyalty program membership, providing a more personalized and relevant experience.\nCreating Targeted Rewards for Loyalty Program Members:\nA brand can create a reward specifically for customers who hold a certain credit card and are members of a particular loyalty program. By mapping rewards to specific loyalty programs, brands ensure that the reward is visible only to customers who meet these criteria, enhancing the perceived value of the reward and fostering exclusivity.\nCustomized Redemption:\nBy mapping loyalty program IDs and tiers, brands can offer personalized rewards based on a customer’s loyalty status. Higher-tier customers may receive exclusive or premium rewards, while lower-tier customers are presented with rewards suited to their level.\nTargeted Promotions:\nMapping loyalty program IDs and tiers enables brands to execute targeted promotions. Specific rewards can be offered to customers based on their loyalty program participation, driving engagement and encouraging higher-tier customers to maintain their loyalty.\nSupplementary Program Integration:\nMapping loyalty program IDs to the rewards catalog allows for integration with supplementary programs. For instance, if a brand partners with an airline, it can map the loyalty program IDs of customers who are also frequent flyers, offering rewards such as discounted or complimentary flights.\nPersonalized Rewards Based on Customer Groups:\nSarah is a loyal customer who enjoys browsing her favorite brand's rewards catalog. She belongs to two special customer groups: \"\nFrequent Shoppers\n\" and\n\"Premium Members\n.\"\nRewards Available:\nReward R1: Designed for customers in the \"Frequent Shoppers\" and \"Summer Sale\" groups.\nReward R2: For those in the \"Frequent Shoppers\" and \"Premium Members\" groups.\nReward R3: For the \"Frequent Shoppers\" and \"Early Access\" groups.\nReward R4: Available to all customers, without any specific group requirements.\nWhen Sarah logs into the rewards catalog, she expects to see only the rewards that are relevant to her. Since she is in the \"Premium Members\" group, she sees:\nRewards Shown: R2, R4\nRewards Hidden: R1, R3 (because she isn’t in the \"Summer Sale\" or \"Early Access\" groups)\nThis personalized experience makes Sarah feel valued and ensures she only sees rewards she can redeem.\nReward Experience for a Non-Customer Group Member:\nEmma has not joined any specific customer groups, but she is still an important customer to the brand.\nRewards Available:\nReward R1: For \"Frequent Shoppers\" and \"Summer Sale\" groups.\nReward R2: For \"Frequent Shoppers\" and \"Premium Members\" groups.\nReward R3: For \"Frequent Shoppers\" and \"Early Access\" groups.\nReward R4: Available to all customers.\nSince Emma is not part of any specific groups, when she logs in, she sees:\nReward Shown: R4\nRewards Hidden: R1, R2, R3 (because she doesn’t belong to those groups)\nEven though she isn’t part of any special groups, Emma still feels appreciated with a reward she can redeem.\nUpdated\n2 days ago\nTable of Contents\nUse cases"

This will allow them to have more flexibility in redeeming their points and enjoy the benefits associated.\nEnhancements made for points redemption from group wallet:\nEvery group has a primary user and secondary users. For identifiers, it can be group ID/ primary user ID/ External ID of the group.\nIn the isRedeemable and Redeem API, you can now pass the group identifier along with the user ID to redeem the points from the group wallet and issue the reward.\nSample request for issue with group ID:\ncurl --location

group today as that functionality is not supported.\nIn Loyalty side in the redemption event, write the rule for the group and configure redeem points action.\nIf \"Friends & Family\" group is enabled, choose the redemption options from the Advance settings, and enable redemption.\nIf \"Fleet\" group is enabled, in Redemption event, write the rule \"currentEvent.IsUserGroupInfopresent\" and configure redeem points action. Within the action, the option should be selected as group.\nThe validation checks for accessing points from the group wallet is entirely managed by the EMF side. It relies on the group settings to determine which users have the authority to redeem points from the group wallet.\nIf either of the user_group2_primary_user_id or user_group2_id or user_group2_external_id is not null, the transaction will be treated as group loyalty redemption.\nFor more information, refer to\nthis\n.\nUpdated\n8 months ago"

This feature addresses the following key requirements:\nModule-Specific Rewards: Enables brands to link rewards to specific modules such as Loyalty Programs, Milestones, Campaigns, Journeys, and Goodwill.\nEnhanced Control: Brands can now define and update the ownership of rewards, allowing for better management and control over the reward ecosystem.\nDetailed Reporting: The addition of owner details facilitates more nuanced reporting, helping brands understand the performance of rewards across different modules.\nKey Concepts\nOwner Entity :The OWNER entity consists of two crucial values:\nOwner Type(ENUM) : Defines the module to which the reward is attributed (e.g., Loyalty Program, Milestones, etc.).\nOwner Id : The unique identifier associated with the Owner Type module (e.g., Loyalty Program ID).\nConstraints and Validations\nOwner Type cannot be NULL : If a reward needs to be owned by a specific module, the Owner Type must be provided.\nOwner Id can be NULL: However, if an Owner Type is specified, Owner Id becomes mandatory for issuing rewards.\nMultiple Owner Ids are supported: A single reward can be linked to multiple instances of the same Owner Type.\nUpdate Constraints: Owners can be added or changed for upcoming rewards, but not for live rewards.\nRefer to the API documentation below:\nCreate reward with owner\nUpdate reward with owner\nIssue a Reward\nClaim a reward\nUpdated\n7 months ago"

These features empower users to curate customized catalogs that effectively showcases rewards to their audience, enhancing the overall user experience.\nGrouping Rewards:\nGrouping rewards allows brands to categorize them into distinct sections based on common themes, types, or purposes. This feature enables users to create a structure within their reward catalog, making it easier for customers to navigate and find relevant rewards. For example, rewards can be grouped into categories such as \"Featured Rewards,\" \"Exclusive Offers,\" or \"Seasonal Rewards.\"\nRanking Rewards:\nRanking rewards enables brands to assign ranks for reward groups as well as ranks for the individual rewards in that group. By assigning ranks, brands can ensure that the most relevant or valuable rewards are prominently displayed to customers. This feature allows brands to highlight specific rewards or promotions based on their strategic objectives or user preferences. For instance, brands can prioritize certain reward groups assigning them higher ranks and can also prioritize rewards within a group.\nWhat's New\nMultiple Group Tagging: Link a single reward to multiple groups.\nGroup-Specific Ranks: Define ranks for rewards within each group.\nOptional Features: Group tagging and rank assignment are optional and independent of individual reward ranks.\nEnhanced API Responses: Return detailed group tags and ranks in API responses.\nBenefits:\nEnhanced User Experience: Grouping and ranking rewards create a more organized and user-friendly catalog, making it easier for customers to browse and engage with rewards.\nEffective Promotion: By highlighting specific rewards through grouping and ranking, users can drive attention to key rewards or offers, increasing customer engagement and conversion rates.\nImproved Navigation: Grouping rewards into categories and ranking them based on priority streamlines the browsing experience for customers, helping them find relevant rewards more efficiently.\nFor example, in the below screenshot, Recommended Products have a higher priority than Home & Kitchen Category. Within each defined group, rewards are sorted based on their rank.\nUse Cases\nFlexible Reward Tagging: Mark a reward with multiple groups and define ranks within each group to showcase rewards effectively.\nExample: Reward 1 is tagged with Group 1 (Rank 1) and Group 2 (Rank 3). When fetching rewards for Group 1, Reward 1 appears first due to its higher rank within the group.\nIndividual Rank Sorting: When fetching rewards with sortOnRank=true, sort by individual rank first. If no rank is defined, use the creation date.\nExample: Reward 1 (Rank 1) appears before Reward 2 (Rank 2) when sorted by individual rank, followed by rewards with no rank sorted by creation date.\nGroup-Specific Sorting: When fetching rewards for a particular group, sort based on the rank within that group.

By setting limits at the organizational and reward type levels, brands can control customer activity on the rewards catalog and encourage point usage during transactions, ultimately driving more business.\nPoints redemption restrictions:\nUsers can define fixed window restrictions of daily, weekly, and monthly cycles for\npoints redemption in the catalog, either for the entire catalog or for a specific redemption type or customer's loyalty program/tier/supplementary program/labels/segments\nor all of these with this\nAPI\nUsers can update these restrictions with this\nAPI\nUsers can select the start day of the week for their org with this\nAPI\n. Default Value will be Monday.\nThis value will be applicable to all the restrictions under the org which are using frequency type as weekly limit to determine the start of the week.\nUsers can check the defined restrictions for points redemption with this\nAPI\n.\nUsers can see the consumed points out of the total limit for a particular customer with this\nAPI\n.\nWhen the issueReward call is made for a particular reward for a particular customer, system will check all the defined restrictions like individual reward restrictions and org level points redemption restrictions. If any of the limit is consumed, the reward will not be issued. Refer to this\nAPI\nfor error scenarios.\nAt one point of time, brands can define both point restrictions at org level, at reward type level, at customer's loyalty program level, tier, supplementary program, labels and segments to control the redemption of points in the catalog\nUse cases:\nBrands can define that they want to restrict the points redemption for the catalog to 10,000 points per month per customer.\nBrands can define that they want to restrict the points redemption for the voucher type of rewards to 500 points per week per customer.\nBrands can define that they want to restrict the points redemption for the miles type of rewards to 1000 points every 10 days per customer.\nBrands can define that they want the users to only burn 10,000 points in overall rewards catalog in a month and 1000 points on vouchers catalog in a month.\nOnce 1000 points are burned by the customer on vouchers catalog in a month, no more points can be used for redemption in vouchers catalog, but customers can still go ahead and burn their points for reward types other than vouchers like charity/miles/cashback etc.\nProgram-Based Limits: Customers in loyalty program name Skymiles can redeem up to 10,000 points in the catalog, with specific limits like 2000 points for miles type of rewards.\nLabel-Based Limits: Fraudulent users can redeem 0 points in the catalog, while other users don’t have any restriction on the points redemption in the catalog.\nTier-Based Limits: Base tier users in program name Skymiles can redeem 500 points, silver tier users can redeem 2500 points and gold tier users can redeem upto 5000 points in the catalog.\nTime-Based Restrictions: Set daily, weekly, or monthly limits, e.g., only 2,000 points can be redeeemd in the catalog every month.\nUpdated\n8 months ago"

With options including FREE, POINTS, CASH, CONV_RATIO and POINTS_CASH, brands gain enhanced flexibility and control over reward issuance.\nThis feature enables customers to receive a reward either by redeeming their points or by making a cash payment or both. Cash transactions or any other mode of payment occur outside the system and are not subject to validation within the system.\nThe supported payment modes are:\nFREE: This payment mode incurs zero cost, requiring neither points nor cash.\nPOINTS: Loyalty points are redeemed from the customer's wallet to issue the reward.\nCASH: The reward is issued without redemption or validation, assuming the tender transaction occurred outside the system (upstream system).\nPOINTS_CASH: In this payment mode, the system issues rewards based on redeeming both cash and loyalty points from the customer's wallet. The assumption here is that the cash transaction has been completed successfully, and the reward is issued based solely on this external transaction.\nCONV_RATIO: The rewards system calculates the equivalent miles based on the points provided in the issue reward request basis the conversion ratio of the reward. For example:\nIf the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants to burn 1500 points and the same points worth of miles need to be credited to his account, the rewards system calculates miles worth 1500 points based on the conversion ratio value i.e. 1500*0.44 = 660 miles\nIf the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants 1000 miles to be credited. The reward system calculates the points to be redeemed i.e. 1000/0.44= 2272 points will be deducted.\nDefining multiple payment modes for a single reward : Offer rewards with multiple payment options, giving customers the flexibility to choose their preferred payment method. For example,\nCustomers can get the cinema ticket either in 16,000 Points OR 10,000 ShowPoints + $72\nCustomers can get the merchandise in 1000 points OR 500 points + 5$ or 10$\nDuring the issue call, the system records the payment mode used to issue the reward at the reward level.\nValidations\nIf payment config is not set, type is not FREE_VOUCHER and intouchPoints is 0, an exception will be thrown saying either define the points greater than 0 or type should be FREE_VOUCHER\nCONV_RATIO mode is supported only for CHARITY, MILES, CASH_WALLET, AUCTION, PHYSICAL_REWARD, GIFT_CARD, SWEEPSTAKES type of redemption types.\nIf type is FREE_VOUCHER and payment mode is set then, it will be FREE i.e. no points will be deducted.\nMaximum of 5 mode of payments can be added against a single reward\nExcept free mode of payment and conversion ratio, all the other mode of payments can be combined as the user will never say that reward is free as well as can be bought with 500 points or 10$ cash.\n📘\nNote:-\nNew brands should no longer use the\n\"intouch points\"\nfield.

This is especially useful for tracking rewards fulfilled outside the Capillary system.\nKey Features:\nStandard Field - STATUS:\nA new ENUM field called STATUS is now available in the issueReward call to track the current status of reward fulfillment (e.g., received, in-progress, pending, denied, completed).\nThis field is optional and validated against predefined values.\nCustom Fields:\nIssue Reward call now supports custom fields with data types such as String, Integer, Date, and Boolean.\nCustom fields are unique at the organization level, with options for default values and case sensitivity.\nA max of 10 custom fields can be passed in the issue Reward call\nIntegration with Other APIs:\nThe newly introduced fields are supported by the getPurchasedRewards API and membercare API, ensuring consistent data representation across platforms.\nBenefits:\nEnhanced Metadata Handling : Improved tracking of reward fulfillment statuses and additional metadata to streamline operations.\nImproved Customer Interactions :Real-time updates and detailed information available on partner portals and mobile apps, enhancing customer satisfaction.\nSteps to follow for fulfillment status:\nDefine the predefined values for fulfillment statuses using this API:\nCreate Fulfillment Status\n.\nUpdate the predefined values for fulfillment statuses using this API:\nUpdate Fulfillment Status\n.\nRetrieve the predefined values for fulfillment statuses using this API:\nGet Fulfillment Status\n.\nIssue Reward Call:\nUse these fulfillment statuses in the issueReward call (single or bulk). Here, it will be validated against predefined values.\nIssue Reward (Single)\nIssue Reward (Bulk)\nUpdate the fulfillment status using the update txn API:\nUpdate txn API\nRetrieve Fulfillment Status:\nCall the purchased rewards for user API or txn level API to see the value of the fulfillment status of the reward.\nGet Purchased Rewards for User\nGet Txn Level Details for User\nSteps to follow for txn custom fields:\nCreate custom fields with scope as ISSUE_REWARD using this API:\nCreate custom field\nUpdate custom fields with scope as ISSUE_REWARD using this API:\nUpdate custom field\nRetrieve custom fields with scope as ISSUE_REWARD using this API:\nGet custom field\nIssue Reward Call:\nUse these custom fields in the issueReward call (single or bulk)\nIssue Reward (Single)\nIssue Reward (Bulk)\nUpdate the custom fields using the update txn API:\nUpdate txn API\nRetrieve txn custom fields:\nCall the purchased rewards for user API or txn level API to see the value of the txn custom fields of the reward.\nGet Purchased Rewards for User\nGet Txn Level Details for User\nUsing the IssueReward API to pass fulfillment status and txn custom fields:\nPassing STATUS and Custom Fields:\nInclude the STATUS field and any txn custom fields in the issueReward call.\nBulk Issue:\nSTATUS and custom fields can also be passed in bulk issue calls.\nEnsure that the STATUS and custom fields are included for each reward in the bulk call.\nIssue reward APIs\nIssue Reward (Single)\nIssue Reward (Bulk)\nExample Use Case:\nFulfillment Process:\nA reward partner logs into the partner portal and sees a list of rewards with a pending STATUS.\nUpon receiving a fulfillment request, the partner updates the STATUS to confirmed.\nAdditional metadata such as ticket number or order ID can be entered.\nOnce fulfillment is complete, the STATUS is updated to completed.\nCustomer View:\nEnd customers can view the STATUS of their rewards and any additional information on their mobile app, providing transparency and enhancing their experience.\nBy following these steps, reward partners and brands can effectively use the new STATUS and custom fields to manage reward fulfillment and provide a better experience for end customers.\nUpdated\n6 months ago"

For example, customers who complete a game can be entered into a draw for a free tank of gas.\nAllow customers to play games for the chance to win instant rewards, such as a free car wash or a discount on their next fuel purchase. This can be a great way to keep customers engaged and coming back to your fuel stations.\nFor more use cases and case studies refer to the\nCataboom Case Studies\ndocumentation.\nCreating games on CataBoom\nCataboom's easy-to-use platform allows you to create gamification experiences with a variety of games and challenges. You can choose from a wide range of games such as quizzes, surveys, polls, scratch-off, spin the wheel, trivia, and more. Each game or challenge can be customized to match your brand's look and feel, and you can also set goals and rewards for players.\nFor information on creating games on the CataBoom platform, refer to the\nCataBoom Platform Training Guide\n.\nAnalyzing player behaviour and performance\nCataboom offers valuable insights into player behaviour and performance. You can observe the number of participating players, the rewards they are earning, and how they are engaging with your gamification experiences. This information can be utilized to optimize your gamification experiences and enhance player engagement.\nTo export the list of winners or any associated play data, navigate to the Activity tab, then click on the required CSV file. This action will download a report with all play data.\nFor information on the games activity data report, you can refer to this\nSample Activity Data\nof a game on the Cataboom platform.\nSetting up rewards and incentives\nOn the Capillary loyalty platform, you can create a variety of rewards, such as points and coupons. These rewards are redeemable for real-world prizes or virtual items. Incentives can be set up to encourage players to participate and reach specific goals. This can be achieved using behavioural events in Loyalty.\nBrands can set up the game and encourage customers to play it using any of the following methods:\nScanning the QR code\nSending an email containing the game URL\nPlaying the game within the app\nTo configure a game and reward the customer, follow these steps:\nSet up the games on the Cataboom platform.\nConfigure behavioural event in Loyalty and link it to the eventname on Cataboom.  For information on configuring behavioural events, refer to the\nBehavioural event documentation\n.\nConfigure a writeback URL in Cataboom to automatically trigger the configured behavioural event whenever a customer plays a game.\nRecord the relevant data generated during gameplay and use webhooks to transmit this data to the Capillary platform.\nSet Up Rules and Targets in Loyalty Events. Perform the following:\nNavigate to Loyalty events.\nLocate the configured behavioural event.\nSet up rules and targets for specific customers\nUpon meeting the specified criteria, customers will automatically receive their rewards (points, coupons, gift vouchers, etc.) in the Loyalty program.\nTracking the behavioural events:\nYou can see the history of Behavioral Events data of the customer on Membercare. For more information, refer to the\nMember Care documentation\n.\nConfiguring games on CataBoom\nPerform  the following to configure games on CataBoom:\nSign into the CataBoom account.\nNavigate to\nHome Page > Manage Users and Campaigns\n.\nIf required, click\nManage Users\nand update the roles for the members in the account.\nClick\nCampaigns\nto create new games.  You can also search for existing games.\nIn the\nCampaign Name\nfield, enter name for the Campaign. URL will be automatically added once you enter the name\nFrom the\nGame Category\ndrop-down, select the category of the game and the type of game.\nClick\nCreate\n.\nThe campaign is created.\nConfigure the game as required.\nOnce you click on the game URL, the following screens will appear based on the configuration:**\nOptional screen:\nGame screens\nFulfillment form to share the rewards\nFAQ:\nHow to get access to the Cataboom platform?\nBrands will get access to the platform once they sign up the contract with Capillary to integrate the games.\nHow does the pricing work?\nFor the license to access Cataboom platform and over 200 different games, Cataboom needs to understand the number of members and active members.  They would like to know the number of countries now and where the brand will be by the end of the year.  Also, how many game experiences per person the brand anticipates.  For example, Todd would only have one “campaign/game” to play at any given moment.\nCataboom will be able to give the full pricing picture after that. Required information:\nExpected player base with certain growth projections\nNumber of games the brand would want to implement\nHow does the integration take place and how much time it requires?\nWebhook URL / behavioral events integration with middle layer. 3-4 mandays of effort. Coupon issual is at our end. So far, our integration supports lead capture (acquisition campaign) and customer retention activities and issue of coupons from our end.\nHow are the games integrated on the mobile app?\nCataboom <-> App: web link URL, via iFrame for mobile app\nWhat is the lead time to launch a game?\n4-5 days, Majority of the time is spent on designing the artwork of games.\nWho will create the gamification artwork for brands?\nBrand itself or the CSMs\nHow will the customization of games happen?\nFor advanced game setups - Cataboom will map a dedicated POC and generally the SLA here will depend on the requirement\nWhat are the reports generated from the data generated from game plays and where is the reporting available, on Cataboom platform or on Capillary platform?\nYou can get some basic numbers - Number of Plays, Unique plays from Cataboom\nPoints allocated for the corresponding promotion can be extracted from Insights+\nBrand gets all the promotion data from capillary as a part of daily feed.\nWhat is the measurement of success for gamification?\nKey KPI is engagement. This means the number of customers who played the game, how many times they played the game. If the game is tied to any objective such as acquisition, re-activation, cross-sell etc. the brand can see if the campaign impacted those KPIs.\nHow will the production  bugs be taken care of?\nThese will be raised directly to\n[email protected]\nCataboom will share the governance doc and escalation matrix\nCan the marvel rewards be issued when a customer wins the game?\nBrands can issue 100% off coupons and customers can use those coupons to get the free products.\nCan games be issued to a particular segment of customers? For example, only top tier customers will see the game on the app and no other person will see the game.\nIssuance of games to specific customers is not possible today, this will be an enhancement at Capillary’s end and will be available after 2 quarters.\nBut, the brands can use the metadata related to their customers to match the metadata at cataboom’s end and show the games only to customers where this metadata matches.\nCan one behavioral event be used for setting up multiple games if the attributes are same?\nAt different times yes, not at the same time. But now you can set up multiple behavioral events and link them to the promotions.\nIs middle layer setup required every time a new game is set up as the event_name will be changed with each game or will it be the same in every game?\nNow with the new enhancement in behavioral events, middle layer is not required.\nSample Games\nCatch the shoes and win:\nhttps://secure.cataboom.com/direct/test-burrow-game\nScratch and win:\nhttps://secure.cataboom.com/direct/test-scratchandwin\nSpin the wheel:\nhttps://secure.cataboom.com/direct/test-spinthewheel\nCatch the planes Belavia Game:\nhttps://secure.cataboom.com/direct/airline\nQuick play:\nhttps://secure.cataboom.com/direct/test-quick-play\nUpdated\n7 months ago\nTable of Contents\nSample use cases:\nCreating games on CataBoom\nAnalyzing player behaviour and performance\nSetting up rewards and incentives\nTracking the behavioural events:\nConfiguring games on CataBoom\nFAQ:\nSample Games"

Marvel games allow configuration for up to three different games as follows:\nSpin the wheel\nScratch and win\nPick and Win\nTo configure games on Marvel, perform the following:\nGo to the old UI of Capillary and type Marvel in the search bar. Once you click on Games, you will be redirected to the below page for your org.\nLanding page of Marvel Games\nEnter the game details.\nGameType : This is a custom metadata. The type of game doesn’t matter to the backend, this is for Ui purposes.\nSPIN_THE_WHEEL\nSCRATCH_AND_WIN\nPICK_AND_WIN\nUser Play Limit : This is used to define how many times a customer can play the game.\nStart Date and End Date for the game\nAvailability for all : This is a custom metadata. In this case, there is no need to allocate the game, by default, it is available to everyone.\nWhen this option is true, the downstream system will show the game to everyone.\nWhen this option is false, then the system expects that this game is allocated to a certain audience via APIs.\nName : name for the game\nDescription : description for the game\nGame Image : Data is stored in AWS S3.\nTerms and conditions : Data is stored in AWS S3.\nGame Items:\nLet’s say you are running a game : Spin the wheel. In this game, you can have 3 options or 5 options and so on. All these options are configured and are called as game items. At least 2 game items need to be defined.\nEach option has to have a probability in a particular game.\nThen each option will have its limit/capping, like option 1 can be used only 100 times, option 2 can be used 150 times and once option 1 is consumed, this option will not be given to the user\nThen there will be customer level capping, like a customer can play the game only 200 times and post that user will not be allowed to play.\nThere can be game level capping too, like a game can be played in total for only 50,000 times\nEach option is linked to a reward\nName : Name for the game item, ex : 20% off on cart.\nDescription : Description for the game item.\nReward/Redemption : Can be 10% off, free product, etc. APIs have to be called to issue these rewards to the customers.\nMaximum Availability : If the game can be played 1000 times, what is the availability for this game item. Ex: a 20% off coupon can be issued only 100 times if the max availability is 100, post that it will not be issued.\nWinning Probability : Ex: If the game can be played 1000 times, then 25% winning probability indicates that 250 people can win this option.\nAdvanced settings\nUpload Image : custom metadata\nColor code : custom metadata\nThis is defined at the game level and not the player level. Either maximum availability or winning probability is defined.\nYou can add as many game items as you want.\nRedemption:\nBefore you set up a game, redemptions have to be defined. Here, you can set up the API configurations.\nGamification supports third party APIs as well.\nBasic details:\nName\nDescription\nReward/Redemption Type (Custom metadata)\nVOUCHER\nPOINTS\nPHYSICAL_VOUCHER\nAPI:\napiUrl\napiType\napiResponseExtractKey\napiBody\napiHeaders\napiQueryParameters\nLanguage\nYou can add languages at org level and these languages can be added for all games set up for the org.\nAPIs:\nThere are 2 user facing APIs:\nAPI to allocate games : Games need to be issued for the customer to play it\nAPI to play the game\nDB:\nFor each game, there will be a different gameID\nAllowed_play vs max_play_allowed : max_play_allowed is how many times a customer can play the game. Each allocation allows the user to play the game only once.\nAllowed play is how many times a game is allocated to the customer.\nFAQs:\nGame is still running, but the rewards have been exhausted. What will happen in that case?\nThere can be multiple approaches here:\nYou can remove the game item if it is consumed completely OR\nDisable the game and it will no longer be available to play OR\nChange the reward linked to the particular game item\nCan you edit a game once it is live?\nYes, the game can be edited post it is live\nCan the sum of winning probability be >100% as the UI allows to create it?\nYes, it can be more than 100%. Let's say there are 2 line items, with 50% and 70% winning probability. Gamification makes a big number out of it(Eg: 50_500(25000), 70_500(35000)) and get a random number between 1 and 60000(25000+35000=60000).\nFor 1-25000, this is for Item1\nFor 25001-60000, this for Item2\nSo there is no harm to keep winning probability more than 100%\nCan you edit an expired game?\nNo, expired games can't be edited\nUpdated\nover 1 year ago"
